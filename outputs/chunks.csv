The greater majority of the country were the general public and they The traditional life style of this country was based on the village. a local self–sufficient economic system because the people of the village produced their food in the village itself.,"[75, 76]","['island was still under the power of the Kandyan kingdom during the time in which', 'lived on agriculture.']"

establish an economic system that met the objectives of the English. wanted to invest money on profitable business in order to avoid financial difficulties The objective of the Colebrooke Commission was to build a situation in which the private entrepreneurs could invest money because the,"[76, 77]","['In the past, those who supplied compulsory service to the king were awarded land']"

Colebrooke further recommended the establishment of a savings bank in the island.,[77],"['Colebrooke further recommended the establishment of a savings bank in the island.', 'class that worked for wages in Sri Lanka.']"
The purpose of establishing a bank was to allow the entrepreneurs who invest money on estate cultivation obtain money to a reasonable interest. There was a broad change in the economy of Sri Lanka after Colebrooke recommendations came into effect in 1833.,"[77, 78]",['Colebrooke further recommended the establishment of a savings bank in the island.']

• High profit drawn through coffee plantation. • Ability to get cheap labour from the Indian labourers in the plantation sector. Some other reasons for the expansion of coffee cultivation were the reduction of export tax for coffee and releasing of the labourers who worked in coffee plantation,[79],['coffee plantation in the 19th century.']
