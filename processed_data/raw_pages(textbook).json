    "C H A P T E R\n\nIndustrial Revolution\nIntroduction\nThe broad change generated by man in the industrial and technological fields\nwithin a period of about six decades by producing goods with the help of machines\ninstead of manual labour is termed as \u201cthe industrial revolution.\u201d\n1.1 Beginning and Development of the Industrial Revolution\nThe industrial revolution began towards the latter part of the 18th century in Britain.\nIt was limited to Britain for about another half century. Yet, by the 19th century, the\ninfluence of the industrial revolution spread to the other countries in Europe and\nthe rest of the world.\nTrade was the major reason for the emergence of the industrial revolution in Europe.\nWhen the situation of Europe in the 18th century is analyzed, it can be seen that\nFrance, Portugal and Spain other than Britain engaged themselves in colonization\nand extensive trade. Therefore, it is important to inquire into the reasons why such\na revolution began in Britain.\n\uf076 Reasons for the Emergence of the Industrial Revolution in Britain\nFinancial and commercial affairs started developing in Europe since the 16th century\nand by the 18th century, Britain had surpassed some of the other leading European\ncountries such as Holland, France, Portugal and Spain. As a result a wealthy class\nwho could invest money on industries was created in that country. At the same\ntime, there was a rapid growth in the population of Britain which resulted in a high\ndemand for goods and in turn producing goods to meet the increasing demand\nbecame a challenge. This led to a development in the industrial sector. Further, there\nwas an expansion of the knowledge of science as a result of the Renaissance that took\nplace in Europe in 14th and 15th centuries. This knowledge was used in producing\n- 1 -",
    "new machinery. Minerals such as iron and steel that were necessary in producing\nmachinery too were found in Britain. Not only that Britain easily found things like\ncoal which played a major role in producing energy.\nThough there was a heavy population in contemporary kingdoms such as France,\nthe development of trade in those countries was limited in comparison to Britain.\nBut, Britain had obstructed the commercial relationships of its colonies with other\ncountries in the world by imposing several commercial laws. Thus, Britain was\nable to maintain a high demand for their productions in its own colonies because\nthey had no other choice than importing those productions from Britain. Some of\nthose products with high demand in Britain were suitable for the production using\nmachines. One example is the high demand placed upon British cotton clothes\nby India. Though there was an increasing demand for British cotton clothes, they\ndid not have the ability to increase the production within a short period with the\nexisting production methods. Because of the high demand that existed for the British\nproductions, there arose a need in increasing the production in a short period. It is\nas a solution to this challenge that there was a rapid development in the industrial\nfield.\nThere were several changes in the agriculture field too in contemporary Britain.\nThere, the rich landowners combined small pieces of land that belonged to poor\nfarmers and made large farms. This is termed as the \u201cencroaching movement.\u201d As\na result of this, the farmers who lost their land migrated to cities in search of jobs.\nThe extra labour that was generated as a result was able to be used for the industrial\ndevelopment.\nUnlike in other countries, in Britain talented individuals had the opportunity to earn\nmoney irrespective of their social status. This free social environment in the attitudes\nsupported the spread of novel ideas and it was conducive for the development of\nthe industrial sector. Further, together with the development of the economy, the\nemergence of new banks and financial organizations that provided capital for the\nindustries and businesses was seen.\nThe political stability that was prevailing in Britain too helped the industrial\nrevolution. The parliament provided the freedom, tax relief and support to engage\nin business activities for the economic development.\nCompared with the other countries in Europe, Britain had the most conducive\nenvironment for the industrial revolution. A number of features such as being a\nsmall island, ability to build a web of markets throughout the country, ability to\n- 2 -",
    "charge high prices for productions and London city being a centre that distributed\nraw materials, capital and products; helped Britain to surpass other countries in the\nindustrial production field.\n1.2. Rise of the Industrial Revolution\nThe industrial revolution in Britain was based on three industries as given below.\n\uf034 Textile industry\n\uf034 Iron and steel industry\n\uf034 Coal industry\nThe development that occurred in these fields resulted in the gradual progress in\nother fields such as transport, communication and agriculture.\n\uf034Textile Industry\nTextile producers in Britain faced a challenge of increasing their textile products to meet\nthe high demand that came from their own colonies. Weaving clothes became a little faster\nwith the invention of the flying shuttle by John K. in 1733. But the slowness in preparing\nthreads needed in weaving clothes still remained a problem. According to the situation that\nwas there at that time, threads produced\nby six thread makers per day were\nenough only for one weaver to work for\none day. Therefore, there was some idea\nof increasing the pace of spinning. As a\nresult of that enthusiasm, a person called\nJames Hargreaves produced a machine\ncalled \u2018Jenny\u2019 in 1764 for cotton weaving.\nThis machine was a manually operated\none. Later in 1769, Richard Arkwright\nproduced a more efficient, water powered\nspinning wheel. It was named as \u2018water\nFig 1.1 \u2013 The Jenny machine produced by James turbine\u2019. Arkwright\u2019s creation was an\nHargreaves for spinning cotton in 1764\nimportant production when compared\nto the other machines used for the same\npurpose in the past. But it was difficult to be used in houses because it was very big in size.\nOn the other hand, because a fast tide of water was needed to run the machine, it could be\nused only in such places where there was a continuous supply of water.\n- 3 -",

This helped steel industry. These mew creations paved\nto produce finer and stronger the way for a rapid improvement in iron\nthreads. Then around 1785, Edmund and steel industry.\nCartwright found a way of running\nthe \u2018Mule\u2019 by steam power. Thus,\nwithin a period of about 30 years\nnew machines and novel technical\nmethods were invented to make\nspinning cotton more efficient.\nFig 1.2 \u2013The water powered spinning machine Hence, there was a big revolution in\nFig 1.3 Henri Bessemer\u2019s oven for producing steel\nproduced by Richard Arkwright the weaving industry during a short\nperiod of time.\n\uf0ea ACTIVITY 2\n\uf0ea ACTIVITY 1\n1.

British people produced iron and There are so many coal mines in Britain. South Wales, Yorkshire, Lancashire are\nsteel even before the industrial revolution to make weapons, agricultural equipment some places where coal mines are situated. Coal was popular as a cheap and efficient\nand household tools. They used firewood to smelt ore for this purpose. It was difficult fuel for smelting ore, running machines and household chores. Though the demand\nto meet the huge demand for iron and steel needed for the production of machinery for coal increased with the industrial development, mining coal was difficult.\nthat emerged as a result of the industrial revolution using firewood. Several new inventions were made in order to find solutions to the problems such\nas removing the water that gathered in the mine when it was dug deep, poisonous\nHence, alternative methods had to be looked for. In 1730 the method of smelting gases found in the depth, increasing heat and providing light to the depth.\nore using coal was found by Abraham Darby. They produced molded iron in this\nmethod.

In 1839, a method was found to take coal out of\nthe mines using iron cables instead of the old method of taking them out by women\nand children using copper cables.\nThe development of the coal industry resulted in several by products. Tar obtained\nby burning coal was used in road construction. Paints that were necessary in dyeing\nclothes too were made with the help of coal. It was further used to produce medicine,\nperfumes, oil and fertilizers.\nFig 1.6 \u2013 The way\ncoal was taken out\nof mines by women\nand children\n- 6 -",

When the nature of this\nexpansion is considered, two types of expansions can be identified as expansion of\nindustrial revolution to other fields and expansion of industrial revolution to other\ncountries.\n1. Expansion to other fields\nThe new knowledge that emerged in relation to industrial and technological fields as\na result of industrial revolution did not limit itself to industries and productions. It\nspread to the other fields too. Fields like transport, communication and agriculture\ntoo had rapid development under the influence of the industrial revolution.\n\uf076 Expansion of transportation\nMany changes took place in the transport sector because of the influence of the\nindustrial revolution. With the development of the industrial sector, a necessity\nof developing a road system arose for transporting raw materials to factories and\ntransporting products to markets. Therefore in 1811, John McAdam introduced a\nnew way of making roads. It is called \u201cthe Macadam Method.\u201d\n- 7 -",

Therefore, hundreds of miles of such roads were built\nin Britain and Scotland within a short period.\nMachines and engines used for transport too developed with the development of\nroads. The production of the steam engine by George Stephenson in 1814 became a\nlandmark in the industrial revolution. As a result, trains could be used to transport\ncoal and other products. The time spent for transport could be minimized by\ntransporting products from factories to markets and transportation cost was\nreduced by being able to transport heavy loads of goods at a time. It is believed that\nGeorge Stephenson who invented the locomotive engine was not able to read and\nwrite till he was 17 years old.\nFig 1.9 The steam engine invented by George\nFig 1.8 George Stephenson Stephenson\nThe development that took place in land transport as a result of the industrial\nrevolution, affected the naval and water transport too.\n- 8 -",
    "In 1807, an American called Robert Fulton produced the steamboat. Henry Bell\nproduced the steam ship in 1811 for passenger transport. It used firewood as fuel at\nthe beginning and later coal. The production of motor car in 1885 by the German,\nDaimler and the production of the aeroplane by Wright brothers in 1903, made\na huge change in the transport system. Thus, as a result of the expansion of the\nindustrial revolution, there was a rapid change in all forms of transport; land, water\nand air transport.\nFig 1.10 Daimler\u2019s motor car Fig 1.11 Aeroplane produced by\nWright brothers\n\uf076 Expansion of Communication Sector\nThere was a rapid development in communication sector too in parallel to the\ndevelopment in transport. The postal service that existed in Britain up to this was\nvery costly. A need arose to exchange letters quickly for a cheaper price in a shorter\ntime for business activities.\nFig 1.12 \u2013 Several experiments to develop communication between two distanced\nplaces using electronic methods were conducted from the beginning of the 19th\ncentury. As a result of this, an apparatus was produced to communicate using\nhuman voice, between two places through cables in 1876. It is called the \u2018telephone\u2019.\nIt was produced by Alexander Graham Bell.\n- 9 -",
    "A new postal service which was called \u2018Penny Postal Service\u2019 was started for this in\n1840. A letter could be sent to any corner of the country by spending just a penny\n(pence) through this.\nThere arose another need for sending messages between two places more quickly\nthan sending letters with the rapid development of industrial and transport sector.\nAs a result of the experiments conducted for this, Samuel Morse was able to start\ntelegraph service in 1844. Sending messages between two places through a cable\nwas started in this method using symbols.\nAn immense change took place in the communication sector in 1895 when\nGuglielmo Marconi invented the method of sending messages through radio signals\nand then John Logie Baird invented the television. These two inventions supported\nnot only the development of communication but also the development of trade and\ncommerce including other economic activities.\nFig. 1.13 John Logie Baird and Fig 1.14 Marconi\u2019s radio\nthe television he invented\n\uf076 Expansion of Agriculture\nThere was a rapid development in agriculture in parallel to the industrial revolution.\nSeveral factors that affected this can be identified as;\n\uf034 Beginning of mega farms\n\uf034 Changing of crops\n\uf034 Using new technology in animal husbandry\n\uf034 Using new agricultural methods and equipment\n- 10 -",
    "The establishment of factories expanded with the industrialization attracting more\npeople to cities. This left their land in villages uncultivated. The rest of the minor\nproprietors had to give up their lands due to various reasons. Such small lands\ngiven up thus and the lands taken over from other farmers were combined together\nto make mega farms. Agriculture developed as a result of cultivating these lands\nwhich came under the encroaching movement.\nChange of crops in cultivation\nhelped to reduce spreading\nof diseases and to increase\nproductivity. Jethro Tull\nintroduced the line sowing\nmethod with horse tethered\nploughs. This method helped\nto reduce the number of seeds\nneeded for sowing and increase\nproductivity.\nFig 1.15 Cultivation using change of crops\nAt the same time, animal products increased due to the new technological methods\nused in animal husbandry. One example is the findings regarding breeding of sheep\nmade by Robert Bakewell.\nThe invention of efficient equipment that came with the industrial revolution\naltered the field of agriculture completely. Machines were produced to clear forests,\nprepare the land and produce seeds. Further, paying attention on producing manure\nto achieve more productivity in agriculture is an important move. As a result of\nexperiments done in this field, a type of manure called \u2018Guano Fertilizers\u2019 was\nproduced in Africa for the first time in 1800. Then it was produced in America also.\nAfter some time chemical fertilizers and agro chemicals were produced.\nAgricultural and animal products could be sold at a cheaper price because they\ncould be produced with less expenditure owing to the store facilities and modern\ntransport methods that came as a result of the industrial revolution. As a result,\nthere was a high demand for agro products.\n- 11 -",
    "2. Expansion to other countries Results of the Industrial Revolution\nThe industrial revolution that began in Britain spread to the countries in the Broad changes occurred in political, social and economic sectors in many countries\ndue to the industrial revolution that took place everywhere in the world. These\nEuropean continent also within a short period of time. Later it went to Asian,\nresults had both good and bad characteristics.\nAmerican and African continents also. There were several reasons for the spread of\nthe industrial revolution to other countries in the 19th century. \uf076 Changes in the Political Field\n\u2022 Increase in demand for goods that came as a result of rapid increase in world The industrial revolution resulted in a wealthy class that invested money for profit\npopulation and an underprivileged class that survived by selling labour. The rich exploited the\nlabour of the underprivileged in their businesses and earned a huge profit. Yet the\n\u2022 Development of travel and transport in Europe\nliving conditions of the labourers who worked in factories were very poor. Because\n\u2022 Discovery of coal in France and Germany\nof this suppression there were many clashes between the rich and the poor including\nthe emergence of labour unions, boycotts, struggles for rights, etc. This situation\nAs a result, other countries in the world too started to speed up their production\nended in the expansion of political beliefs such as socialism and liberalism.\nusing machines in the same way England did. Industrial centres emerged in areas\nthat were situated close to markets and where raw materials were found in abundance\nin Germany and France. Germany that was able to mark an increased industrial\ndevelopment, had become a powerful country at the beginning of World War I.\nThen the industrial revolution spread to other European countries like France,\nBelgium, Austria, Hungary and Prussia. The Austrian empire built roads to a length\nof 30000 miles and Belgium doubled the length of its roads at the same time. Then,\nevery country started laying railways. The effects of the industrial revolution were\nfelt in states in America that existed as colonies of Britain as well. There was a rapid\nindustrial development after independence in that country.\nJapan was an Asian country which had an enormous development in the industrial\nsector during the latter half of the 19th century and the first few decades of the 20th\ncentury. Japan has become a country that holds a competitive place among the\ncountries that have obtained a rapid development in science and technological fields\nFig 1.16 - A struggle for rights by labourers\nby following the western methods and models.\nThe influence of the industrial revolution was greatly felt in many Asian countries Adam Smith presented the concept called \u201claissez-faire\u201d which led to the expansion\nof capitalism throughout the world. Laissez-faire means reducing the government\nincluding China, India and Sri Lanka by the 20th century. Thus the world became a\ninvolvement and giving more allowance for private sector involvement in the\nglobal village because of the industrial revolution that spread to the other countries\neconomic matters. At the same time, as the industrialization spread throughout\nin the world and the rapid development it created in transport and communication\nEurope, there arose a need for getting raw materials for a cheaper price and selling\nfields.\nthe products at a higher prices. Therefore, the European countries had to compete\n- 12 - - 13 -",

Therefore, the European countries had to compete\n- 13 -",
    "for tightening their political grasp in the colonies. This new imperialism which\ncame after 1850 is called neo-imperialism. This struggle of European countries to\ncapture new colonies became a major factor that led to World War I.\n\uf076 Changes in the Economic Sector\nOne change that took place in the industrial revolution is the expansion of\nindustrial products and commercial activities taking the first place in the economy.\nAccordingly, a wealthy class that owned factories and a class of business people\ngradually developed. Farmers who owned small lands had to come to cities and join\nthese factories as they could not carry on working in their farms. Because of that, the\nself-sufficient economy failed and emerged a working class that worked for a salary.\nThus, the agro-economic system broke down and the import-export economy came\nforward. Agricultural production too became industrialized and a number of food\ntypes came to markets. As a result, both local and foreign businessess developed in\nEuropean countries and Asian, African and Latin American countries which were\nthe colonies of European countries. In the same way, the capitalist economic system\ntoo spread rapidly around the globe.\nPrivate entrepreneurs could not afford to invest money on these expanded businesses\nindividually. So, several entrepreneurs got together and formed combined business\ncompanies. These companies expanded their commercial activities into Asian,\nAfrican and Latin American countries with the help of their governments to achieve\ntheir targets.\nAt first, these trade companies consisted of local businessmen only. Yet, towards the\nfirst part of the 19th century, these companies became multi-national companies.\nThese companies that were engaged in production of goods and buying and selling\nsimultaneously were engaged in monetary and banking activities. This made\ntransactions and loan facilities easy for the entrepreneurs.\n\uf076 Impact on the Society\nThe society was influenced both positively and negatively due to the industrial\nrevolution. Many new cities were created as a result of the industrialization and\nthe lives of people who lived there were greatly affected. People could afford to buy\nthose items that were produced in bulk in the factories. At the same time these\nfactories generated a lot of new job opportunities. As a result people could enjoy\nbetter living conditions.\n- 14 -",
    "The number of cities and the\nsize of cities in Europe increased\nvery fast as a result of the\nindustrialization. The only\noutcome of them was that they\nbecame unbearably populated.\nYet, the development of basic\nfacilities of these cities came\nabout very slowly. For an example,\nthough in Vienna, within 20\nyears before 1847 the population\nincrease is 20%, building houses\nincreased in 11.5% only.\nIn many countries of the world\nFig 1.17 \u2013 Child labourers who worked in\nnew cities emerged as a result of\nfactories during the industrial revolution\nthe industrialization and villagers\nbegan to migrate to these cities.

    "C H A P T E R\n\nEstablishment of British\nPower in Sri Lanka\nIntroduction\nYou studied in grade 10, how the Portuguese came to Asia and how the Portuguese\nand the Dutch people occupied the coastal region of Sri Lanka. After those two\nnations, the next European nation that imposed its power on Sri Lanka was the\nBritish. They who spoke English language were called the English. This lesson\nexplains how the English established their power in Sri Lanka and the struggles\nthat arose against them in the first half of the 19th century.\n2.1 Arrival of British in Asia\nThe English who noticed that the Portuguese and the Dutch people were earning a\nlot of profit from the trade activities in Asia, also paid their attention to Asia. As a\nresult, a group of English businessmen established the East India Trade Company\nin December 1600, by a royal warrant obtained from Queen Elizabeth I to do trade\nactivities in Asia. The first fleet of ships of this company had gone to Sumatra islands\nand started trade. Then, another fleet of ships came to India under William Hokins\nand conducted discussions about trade with the Mughal emperor, Jahangir.\nAt the beginning of their visits to Asia, the English tried to tighten their trade\nrelations with Southeast Asian region.\nThere had been fights between the Portuguese and the Dutch to claim the trade\npower in Southeast Asia during the first two decades of the 17th century. At\ncertain occasions, the English have given their assistance to the Dutch against the\nPortuguese. The Dutch never expected to see the English developing a power in\nSoutheast Asian islands where spices grew well, although they obtained the help\nof the English to fight their common enemy, the Portuguese. Because of this, in\n1623, the Dutch attacked a fortress in a spices island, Ambon and killed a group\nof English people living there. As the English did not have sufficient power in the\nregion to retaliate the Dutch attack, they withdrew themselves from the southeast\nasian region. It seems that they completely focused their attention on India after\nthat. - 19 -",
    "It took more than 10 years for the English to establish trade relations with India\nthough they tried it since 1607. As the English worked very tactfully in India, they\nwere able to start trade centres in several areas such as Bombay, Calcutta and Madras\nby the latter part of the 17th century. Yet, the English had to compete with the\nFrench other than the Dutch to protect their trade because from 1664, the French\nalso came to India and established trade centres in places like Pondicherry, Karikal\nand Chadranagar.

The purpose of his visit was to discuss with the king how they\ncould get the assistance of the kingdom of Kandy in the fights to conquer the areas\ngoverned by the Dutch. The king agreed to support the English forces. Yet, the\nEnglish, after capturing the Dutch fortresses, understood that the battle against the\nDutch was not as hard as they anticipated. Therefore, the English did not like to\nshare with the Sinhala kings, the profits they would receive by capturing the Dutch\nheld areas.

He\nstrengthened the convoy with 1164 soldiers and 8\ncannons in order to display their military power\nand get the king\u2019s consent to a treaty which was\nmore beneficial for them.

As a result the envoys had to enter the\nRajasinghe\nkingdom alone leaving the soldiers and cannons\noutside the upcountry. Though MacDowell had discussions with the king and the\nother aristocrats, the king did not agree to the conditions of the British. So, this\nmission became a complete failure.\nNorth was distressed because he could not get the sanction of the king. He considered\nthe independent government of the upcountry as a threat to their power in the\ncoastal regions. Because the British had to employ a massive army for the security\nof the coastal areas and the protection of the inland territories, they were forced\nto bear a huge cost. Another problem they faced was that the general public of the\ncoastal areas still accepted the upcountry king as their king too and when there\nwere insurgencies the upcountry king helped the rebels. The British further knew\nthat if the upcountry king happened to request the support of the French who were\nthe enemies of the British, that would be an added threat to their administration.\nOn the other hand, the English wanted to have contact with Trincomalee which\nwas their main naval centre from the administration centre of Colombo via land.\nThey had to cross the territories of the upcountry in order to keep contact between\nColombo and Trincomalee. The English wanted to build a road between these\ntwo cities. Owing to the above reasons, the British paid their attention to either\nconquering the upcountry or winning their good will.\n- 27 -",
    "\uf076 Invasion of the Hill Country in 1803\nWhen MacDowell\u2019s mission failed to give the expected results, the governor, North\ndecided to invade the hill country. So, North sent two troops of soldiers to the\nhill country from Trincomalee and Colombo in January and February, 1803. In\nthis invasion, which was headed by MacDowell, the British troops entered the hill\ncountry on 21st of February. King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe and the citizens vacated\nthe city as a security measure and started organizing themselves. The British\nnamed prince Muttusami who had been brought to the upcountry with them as the\nking. But, the people of upcountry started to get together with king Sri Wickrama\nRajasinghe and prepared for the war ignoring Muttusami.\nThe British had to face unexpected difficulties with the beginning of the rainy season\nbecause epidemics started spreading among the British troops. At the same time, as\na result of the upcountry people blocking all supply means, the English suffered due\nto lack of food and difficulty of communication with Colombo. The English troops\nsuffered heavy losses under the timely attacks of the upcountry people. Happening\nto let their puppet ruler, prince Muttusami to be captured by the upcountry people,\nprovides evidence to the seriousness of the defeat the British experienced.\nBefore this attack, the governor North did not have a clear understanding about\nthe hill country. Yet, when his invasion ended in defeat, he understood that the\nupcountry kingdom is strong and it cannot be overpowered by such attacks. Hence,\nthe British moved into a highly tactful policy regarding the hill country after the\ninvasion of 1803.\n\uf076 Invasion of the Hill Country in 1815\nThomas Maitland was appointed the governor of Sri Lanka at the end of the\ngovernor North\u2019s session of duty in 1805. Unlike North, he did not hasten to invade\nthe hill country; instead moved into a strategic policy and started carefully laying\nthe platform for a future invasion. He employed an efficient civil servant named\nJohn D'Oyly for this.\n\uf076 John D'Oyly\nJohn D'Oyly was a graduate of the Cambridge University. He tried to understand\nthe local culture after coming to Sri Lanka unlike the others who looked down upon\nit. He engaged himself in studies under the Buddhist monks like Rev. Korathota\n- 28 -",
    "Dhammarama and Rev. Morathota Dhammakkandha. The folklore says that D'Oyly\nwas capable of composing poems in contest to Gajaman Nona. D'Oyly who had an\nexcellent knowledge about local customs was in the habit of chewing betel also. As\na result he was capable of winning the hearts of not only the general public but also\nthe aristocrats of the hill country. D'Oyly completed his duty successfully using his\nsharp intelligence and talents.\nFig 2.5 \u2013 John D'Oyly with the hill country aristocrats\nJohn D'Oyly worked hard to cultivate secret connections with the upcountry\naristocrats and tried to win them towards the English people. Further, he took steps\nto send spies in the disguise of sellers and palm readers and got them to gather all\ninformation about the internal affairs of the kingdom. As a result he was able to\nfind out information about the internal security of the hill country, which all other\nEuropeans were ignorant of. It was Robert Brownrigg that became the governor\nof Sri Lanka after Maitland who took the advantage of the conditions created by\nMaitland and D'Oyly and took further steps to capture the hill country.\nIt was not only the strategies of the British that paved the way to the falling of\nthe hill country to the hands of the British. A number of other situations that\naccelerated the downfall of the hill country had been created during the reign of\nKing Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe. The king who was very young and inexperienced\nseemed to have taken decisions following the advice of his Nayakkar relations. The\nlast two Maha Adhikarams of the hill country had had disagreements with the\nking. Pilimathalawwe Maha Adhikaram who worked to offer the throne to the king\ntoo was sentenced to death by the king as a result of the problems they had with\neach other. There were incongruities between Ehalepola Adhikaram who was the\nsuccessor of Pilimathalawwe Maha Adhikaram and the king.\nDuring the reign of King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe, disparities among the aristocrats\nincreased. As a result, the majority of the aristocrats worked against the king. They\n- 29 -",

The bond between the king and the\npeople had also been broken due to some decisions the king made during the last\nfew years of his reign. The king prohibited staying in the city at night for the people\nwho had come from regions like Sabaragamuwa, Sath Korala and Sathara Korala\nfor the services like extending the Bogambara tank, building the \u2018Paththirippu\u2019\n(the octagon) and renovations of the Kandy city.

    "\uf034 Emergence of Problems about Religion and Culture\nThe people of the hill country did not believe that a set of foreigners who are not\nBuddhists would give the same protection that would be given by a Buddhist king\nalthough the English had promised in the 5th statement of the upcountry treaty to\nprotect Buddhism. This is evident in the statements such as, conducting pageants\nand chanting \u2018sadu, sadu\u2019. Another example for this is the support of monks for the\nstruggle.\nThe people of the hill country suspected that their traditions and culture would\nbe destroyed in the hands of foreigners. Under a traditional ruling system a king\u2019s\nmajor duty was to protect the customs. There were a number of traditions regarding\nthe palace, courts and administration matters. Uniforms were designed for each\npost under the old administration in a way that they were honoured and respected.\nBut, the English soldiers who came to the Kandy city did not follow those traditions.\nAs a result, a gap was created between the British and the people of the hill country\nreligiously as well as culturally. This generated a desire for freedom in the hearts of\nthe upcountry people.\n\uf034 Attacks on the Upcountry Aristocrats\nAlthough the British continued with the traditional upcountry posts according to\nthe 1815 treaty, the social status and the power of the aristocrats were not stable.\nThey had complained to D'oyly that the British soldiers did not respect them. The\ntraditional earnings of the aristocrats too were challenged. One example for this\nis the loss of income the aristocrats suffered because the English cancelled the\ntax called \u201ckadwath badda\u201d. The British could change the traditional posts of the\naristocrats as well. There was a tradition to always appoint a Sinhalese to the post\nof \u2018Madihe Mohandiram\u2019 who was in charge of upcountry transport. But the British\nbreaking this tradition, appointed a Muslim called \u2018Hajji Marikkar\u2019 to this post.\nThis created a distress among the aristocrats of Uva Wellassa. They tend to lead the\nstruggle because their privilege, status and earnings were attacked in many ways.\n\uf034 Nature of the Struggle\nWhile there was a growing displeasure about the British administration among the\nupcountry people, a person called Doresami emerged from Wellassa who claimed\nto be an heir to the throne. The Badulla agent Douglas Wilson, came to know that\nhe was gathering forces to regain the kingdom with the help of the local elite like\n\u2018Kohu Kumbure Rate Rala\u2019. Hence, Douglas Wilson sent a platoon with Hajji\nMuhandiram to arrest Doresami. Yet, he was killed by the rebels. Then Douglas\n- 34 -",
    "Wilson too was killed by an archer when he set out to arrest Doresami. When the\ngovernment noticed that the people of Wellassa were gathering around Doresami,\nthey sent Kappetipola who was in charge of Uva to control the situation. Nevertheless,\nKeppetipola returned the English troops that came with him and joined the rebels.\nThis resulted in the fights spreading to many parts of the upcountry. Among the\naristocrats, only Molligoda and Eknaligoda Disawe did not join the fights.\nDoresami was declared the upcountry king by the rebels under the guidance of\nKappetipola. Kappetipola Disawe was appointed the Mahaadikaram of the new king.\nAnother problem the British faced was the Tooth Relic which was believed to be the\nsymbol of the kingship falling into the hands of rebels. Ehelepola too was suspected\nby the British because of the close kinship he had with the other aristocrats who\nwere leading the struggle though he did not join the fights. Because of that he was\narrested and brought to Colombo by the British.\nThe British were too vicious in\nsuppressing the battle. The governor\nimposed martial law to the upcountry\nin February, 1818. The British troops\nthat were there in the coastal regions\nwere summoned to the upcountry. They\nfollowed a land sweeping policy to wipe\nout the rebels. Setting fire to villages,\narresting as many men as possible and\nprosecuting under martial law were\nsome strategies they used. The upcountry\npeople could not persist with the battle\nin the face of the harsh retaliation of\nthe British. So, the British were able to\narrest several leaders of the battle. Some\nof those arrested were Maththamagoda,\nKobbekaduwa, Dambawinna Disawe\nand Galagedara Mohottala, Basnayaka\nNilame of Katharagama, Butawe Rate\nRala and Ehelepola Adikaram.\nThe English spread news saying that the\nFig 2.9 \u2013 Kappetipola Disawe\none who said to be the king in the battle\nwas not the real Doresami and he was not the real heir to the throne.

By the time of\nthe Kandyan Kingdom \u2018Gamsabha\u2019 had become a minor court in the village.\nThe labour needed for the government was received through the duty service system\nby the administration under the ruling system before 1815.There were two ways of\nproviding service as compulsory service system and duty, based on land occupancy.\nIn the past, those who supplied compulsory service to the king were awarded land\nfor their existence. Those who cultivated these lands which were called as service\npatrimony lands provided necessary services to the king. Officials who received\nthese lands gave them to the general public for cultivation and they had to repay it\nby providing services through labour. It was called as duty of occupancy.\nAll adult males of the country had to serve the king for no salary for a decided\nnumber of days every year. This was conducted under the heads of the village and\nthe Gamsabha . Often, the labour necessary for the common activities of the village\nwas taken from this compulsory service system.\n\uf076 Economic Reforms in Colebrooke Commission\nThe major reason for sending the Colebrooke Commission to Sri Lanka was the\nexpenditure of the government exceeded the income of the government. Colebrooke\ntried to introduce several economic reforms to Sri Lanka because he wanted to\nestablish an economic system that met the objectives of the English. The government\n- 66 -",
    "wanted to invest money on profitable business in order to avoid financial difficulties\nthe government faced. The objective of the Colebrooke Commission was to build\na situation in which the private entrepreneurs could invest money because the\ngovernment could not afford it.\nColebrooke recommended that the government should move into a policy of selling\nlands because the existing traditional land tenure system was an obstacle for the\nprivate entrepreneurship. Thus, both the locals and foreigners had the opportunity\nto buy land as much as they wanted. The civil servants too got the opportunity of\nbuying government lands because Colebrooke recommended that all civil servants\nare permitted to engage themselves in estate cultivation.\nThe investors who bought lands wanted labour to cultivate those lands. According\nto the traditional compulsory service system, people were forced to work for the\ngovernment with no wages. Colebrooke noticed that they were not suitable for\nthe private entrepreneurship and it was an obstacle for the freedom of the people.\nTherefore, he thought of abolishing the compulsory service. As a result, labour\nbecame something that could be bought and that was the beginning of a labour\nclass that worked for wages in Sri Lanka.\nWhen Colebrooke came to Sri Lanka, cinnamon and salt trade was a government\nmonopoly. Continuing a government monopoly does not match with the private\nentrepreneurship. Therefore it was suggested to break the monopoly on cinnamon\nand salt trade and allow the private sector too join that trade. The taxes that were\nthe government income those days were the levies on fish, land and alcohol and\nthey were charged directly. For an example, a portion of the fish caught had to be\nsubmitted as tax. The right to earn taxes was auctioned and the fishermen had\nto pay the tax in fish to those who had bought the tax right. This direct tax was\nproposed to transfer into an indirect tax by issuing permits for boats. Tax on land\nwas also a direct tax. The authority of tax collection was auctioned and those who\nbought it collected taxes from the products of lands. Colebrooke banished it and\nrecommended to collect an equal amount in cash from all lands.\nColebrooke further recommended the establishment of a savings bank in the island.\nThe purpose of establishing a bank was to allow the entrepreneurs who invest money\non estate cultivation obtain money to a reasonable interest.\n- 67 -",
    "\uf076 Development of Plantation\nThere was a broad change in the economy of Sri Lanka after Colebrooke\nrecommendations came into effect in 1833. Foreign investors could buy thousands\nof acres of land in Sri Lanka because there were no rich people among locals\nwho could invest in mega scales though Colebrooke wanted to encourage private\nentrepreneurship. This was not a secret to Colebrooke too.\nForeigners invested money on trade based agriculture which was profitable in the\nforeign market. As a result, there was rapid expansion in plantation sector in the\n19th century.\n\uf076 Plantation of Coffee\nThough coffee plantation began during the Dutch period in small scale in coastal\nareas, because a prominent place was given to cinnamon plantation, coffee plantation\ndid not develop. When the English came to Kandy, coffee plantation had been done\nin several places as a home cultivation. It developed into a plantation during the\nreign of the British. Several factors were there that affected the development of the\ncoffee plantation in the 19th century.\nFactors that helped the development of the coffee plantation:\n\u2022 More investment on coffee plantation by foreigners after the Colebrooke\nreforms in 1833.\n\u2022 Increasing demand for coffee in the European market.\n- 68 -",
    "\u2022 High profit drawn through coffee plantation.\n\u2022 Ability to get cheap labour from the Indian labourers in the plantation sector.\nSome other reasons for the expansion of coffee cultivation were the reduction of\nexport tax for coffee and releasing of the labourers who worked in coffee plantation\nfrom compulsory service system during the time of the governor Edward Barnes\n(from 1824 \u2013 1831).\nCoffee plantation was expanding fast in the upcountry region during the period\nof 1837 -1847. Even the government officers started growing coffee because it was\nvery profitable. Reports say that there were about 500 acres of coffee plantation in\nthe hill county by 1845. Thus, the coffee plantation was successful in areas such\nas Dumbara valley, Gampola, Peradeniya, Matale, Badulla and many areas of the\nCentral Province. The amount of coffee export in 1844, was five times bigger than\nthat of 1834. But after 1844 Sri Lanka had to face a huge challenge in the Landon\nmarket because of the free trade policy of Britain. Furthermore, the downfall of\nthe global market too affected badly on the coffee plantation of Sri Lanka. Because\nof these reasons the demand for coffee decreased and the value of the coffee lands\nwent down in 1848. But this situation reached normalcy again after 1850 with the\nreduction of production cost through efficient estate management and the high\ndemand for coffee in Europe. The major reason for the downfall of coffee plantation\nin Sri Lanka was the leaf disease that spread since 1869. The fungus which was\ncalled \u201cHemileia Vastatrix\u201d spread fast destroying the coffee plantation.\n\uf076 Cinchona and Cocoa\nWhen the coffee cultivation began to deteriorate, some planters started growing\ncinchona and cocoa. Yet cinchona became successful in areas with very high\naltitude only. Cinchona was a plant that was used in the production of the medicine\ncalled quinine and it had a limited demand. Therefore, it was not successful as an\nalternative to the coffee plantation.\nWhen the coffee plantation began to deteriorate, the government encouraged\nthe cocoa plantation. Anyway, the planters had to bear an additional expenditure\nbecause cocoa needed shade in order to grow well. Even during the period when\ncocoa had become a successful plantation. It was not spread more than 1200 acres.\nIt was successful only in Matale district. Cocoa too failed to provide an alternative\nto coffee.\n- 69 -",
    "\uf076 Tea Plantation\nOther crops were tried in the upcountry areas because of the fluctuation of coffee\nprice in the world market. Several such experiments were made on tea plantation\nalso. The Planters' Association sent a group of estate workers to Assam to study\nfurther about tea plantation in 1867. At the same time, James Tailor too experimented\ngrowing tea in several areas of Lulkandura estate. Tea plantation spread to about\n500 acres by 1875 as a result of the above mentioned experiments. Tea plantation\nbegan to expand quickly because many planters took to tea plantation due to the\ndestruction of coffee cultivation. By 1894 the amount of tea planted area had reached\nupto 400,000 acres. Tea plantation spread to the Central, Uva and Sabaragamuwa\nprovinces because it could be grown in any area with more than 6000 feet of altitude\nexcept in the dry zone of the country. Later it was spread to the Southern and\nWestern provinces too. It is reported that there had been 1200 acres of tea in average\nsize and bigger tea estates in the country by 1930.\nWith this expansion of tea plantation, tea became one of the major export products\nin our country. Though the income from tea went down in certain situations due to\nthe excessive tea product after the World War I and the world economic demise in\n1929, later it reached to normalcy.\nFactors that helped the development of the tea plantation:\n\u2022 High demand in the world market for Sri Lankan tea\n\u2022 Conducive environment for tea in many parts of the country except in the dry\nzone\n\u2022 Ability to produce good quality tea with the help of modern factories and\nmachines\n\u2022 Development of transport with the development of roads\n\u2022 Cheap labour received from south Indian labourers\n- 70 -",

    "\uf076 Coconut Plantation\nCoconut is a home crop that existed\nin Sri Lanka from the past. There\nwas an increasing interest on\ncoconut plantation by 1850 due to\nthe fall of coffee prices. A significant\ncharacteristic was the enthusiasm\nshown by the natives than the\nforeigners in the coconut plantation.\nBy 1880, 65% of coconut estate\nowners were Sri Lankans.\nCoconut plantation expanded more in broad flat lands than in the hill country.\nAreas like Kurunegala, Chilaw and Gampaha were prominent among them. By\n1920, 27% of the foreign earnings came from coconut products. A coconut research\ninstitution was established in Lunuwila to develop coconut plantation when the\ncoconut plantation started to expand. It is clear that coconut plantation did not aim\nat export like the other cultivations, owing to the fact that half of the production\nwas utilized for local consumption. Just as roads and railways developed in the hill\ncountry due to tea and coffee plantation, roads in the other parts of the country\nwere developed to support the coconut plantation.\n\uf076 Rubber Plantation\nThough rubber was introduced to Sri Lanka around\n1877, it did not show quick expansion because many\ncultivators during this period were more focused on\ntea plantation. By the beginning of the 20th century,\nrubber plantation expanded because rubber price\nincreased due to the expansion of the motor vehicle\nindutry, suitable rubber species were found for Sri\nLanka together with the development of production\ntechniques and temporary fall of tea prices. Rubber\nplantation which was limited to Kalutara district\nat the beginning later expanded to the Western,\nSabaragamuwa, Southern provinces and some\nparts of the Central Province. By 1920, 30% of the\nexport income was received from rubber products.\nLater a rubber research institution was started in Agalawatta to develop the rubber\nplantation.\n- 72 - - 73 -",

    "C H A P T E R\n\nReceiving of Independence\nto Sri Lanka\nIntroduction\nReceiving of independence to Sri Lanka in 1948 is a historical landmark in our\ncountry. At the same time Sri Lanka got the parliamentary system allowing its people\nto join politics through the representative democracy. New changes occurred in the\npolitical system with the introduction of new constitutions in 1972 and 1978. This\nlesson focuses on the special features of the political system and the trends in the\nsocial and economic systems during the few decades after independence.\n6.1 Soulbury Reforms and Independence\nThe members of the Soulbury Commission that was appointed to investigate\ninto Sri Lanka\u2019s constitutional reforms and give proposals came to Sri Lanka in\nDecember 1944.

Though the first election to be held under the\nSoulbury constitution was scheduled in mid 1947, Britain was reluctant to issue any\nstatement about Sri Lanka\u2019s independence. Because of that the Sri Lankan leaders\nlike D.S. Senanayake logically presented their views on the right of Sri Lankans\nfor independence, to the British. As a result, the secretary of colonies made an\nannouncement two months before the election, declaring independence for Sri\nLanka within the Commonwealth Nations.

    "\uf076 Lanka Sama Samaja Party\nThe Lanka Sama Samaja Party is considered as one of the oldest parties in Sri Lanka.\nThe leaders like Dr. N.M. Perera, Dr. Kolvin R. de Silva, Mr. Philip Gunawardana\nwho went abroad for education learnt about leftist politics in those countries and\nestablished the Lanka Sama Samaja Party in Sri Lanka in 1935 to implement such\npolitics in a way suitable to Sri Lanka. The prime objective of the Lanka Sama\nSamaja Party was to create a communist society in Sri Lanka according to the\ndoctrine of leftist political points of view. Later a fraction of the Lanka Sama Samaja\nParty headed by Dr. S. A. Wickramasinghe established the Lanka Communist Party\nin 1943.\n\uf076 United National Party\nThough by 1946, there were several leftist parties and minority parties, there was\nno party for the politicians who had neutral ideas. The United National Party\nwas started in 1946 under the leadership of Mr. D.S. Senanayake because the first\nparliamentary election was scheduled in 1947. The majority of the members of the\nLanka National Congress and the Sinhala Maha Sabha headed by Mr. S. W. R. D.\nBandaranayake joined the United National Party. As a result, it became a powerful\npolitical party from the beginning. They were able to win 42 seats by presenting 95\ncontesters. They were able to establish a government in1952 by winning 54 seats in\nthe second parliamentary election.\n\uf076 Sri Lanka Freedom Party\nMr. S. W. R. D. Bandaranayake broke away from the United National Party and\nestablished Sri Lanka Freedom Party in 1951. This party paid more attention on\nthe necessities of general public than the UNP and was able to win the support\nof the vernacular scholars, monks and those who valued nationalism. The party\nthat won only 9 seats in the 1951 parliamentary election contested as the Mahajana\nEksath Peramuna by aligning with several other parties and was able to establish\nthe government in 1956 election by securing 51 seats. Mr. Bandaranayake was\nthe Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from 1956 to 1959. After the assassination of Mr.\nBandaranayake, his wife Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayake became the leader of the\nparty.\n- 83 -",
    "\uf076 Other Political Parties\nOther than the above parties that presented candidates around the country in\nelections, there were several parties which were in function. The Labour Party\npioneered by Mr. A. E. Gunasinghe and the Tamil Congress started by Mr. G. G.\nPonnambalam are some examples for such parties. Among them the Tamil Congress\nheld a significant place until the 1956 election. They who paid special attention on\nthe rights of the Tamil people in this country were able to secure 07 seats in the\n1947 election. It seems that the Tamil Congress lost its public support when Mr. J. V.\nChelvanayagam started the Federal Party in 1949.\nAccording to the political party system that exists in Sri Lanka there are a number\nof minor parties other than the two major parties like United National Party and Sri\nLanka Freedom Party. Because of that, there can be situations in which no party can\nclaim a majority in an election. As a result several parties have to come together and\nmake political aligns to establish a coalitional government.\n\uf076 1956 Election and the Social Change\nThe United National Party which was in power continuously after the independence\nwas defeated in 1956 and a new government was established under the leadership\nof S.W. R.D. Bandaranayake. It is believed that a social revolution was made by that\ngovernment because several new forces were rallied round Mr. Bandaranayake to\nfollow a policy of valuing the native language, religion and culture and to attempt to\nsolve some unresolved social and economic problems.\nBecause Mr. D.S. Senanayake who became the Prime Minister in the 1947 election\ndied in March, 1952, his son Dudley Senanayake became the Prime Minister.\nHe became the Prime Minister again in 1952 because the United National Party\nwon that election too. But he resigned from his portfolio in 1953 because of the\nremonstrations that were staged by the leftist parties in protest of rising price of\nrice and other food items. Then, another senior member of United National Party,\nMr. John Kothalawala became the Prime Minister. Though the next parliamentary\nelection was scheduled in May 1957, the Governor General dissolved the parliament\nin February 1956 as instructed by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Kothalawala. As a\nresult there was another election in the country.\nIn the 1956 election, the United National Party contested as a single party where\n- 84 -",

M. R. A. Eeriyagolla\ncame together in forming the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna. The Mahajana Eksath\nPeramuna had entered into a no contest agreement with the Lanka Sama Samaja\nParty and it became advantageous for both the parties.\nThe major issue discussed in the 1956 election stage was the policy of making Sinhala\nthe official language. Even after obtaining independence, English language held a\nspecial position and it became problematic for the vernacular scholars. Because of\nthat, those who rallied round the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna had already accepted\nSinhala naming as the state language as a policy. The United National Party too\nagreed with this policy when the election came at hand.\nThe Mahajana Eksath Peramuna won the election easily because of the support of\nthe Pancha Maha Balavega; monks , doctors , teachers , farmers and labourers were\nwith them. At the same time, fighting as an align signing a no contest agreement with\nthe leftist parties further helped them to win. They secured 51 seats and the Lanka\nSama Samaja Party got 14 seats. The United National Party won 8 parliamentary\nseats only. The Federal Party won 10 seats.\nWith the victory of Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, Mr. S. W. R. D. Bandaranayake\nbecame the Prime Minister. His time marked significant changes in the country.\nSome of his policies and introduced reforms are;\n\u2022 Making Sinhala the state language\n\u2022 Discontinuation of the defence and external affairs conventions signed in 1947\nwith the British\n\u2022 A non-alliance foreign affairs policy\n\u2022 Peoplizing the harbour and transport (buses )\n\u2022 Development of local industries and agriculture\n\u2022 Upgrading the Vidyodaya and Vidyalankara pirivenas to universities with a\nview of developing the higher education\n- 85 -",

The\nindependence Sri Lanka received under this constitution was not complete because\nstill the queen of Britain was considered the leader of the country and there were\ncertain restrictions for the parliament to follow in imposing laws. As a result, the\nnecessity of a new constitution was felt during the time of the Soulbury Commission.\nA successful attempt was made for that with the 1970 election.\nA united align had been established to face the 1970 election by the Sri Lanka\nFreedom Party, the Lanka Sama Samaja party and the Communist Party. They\nsigned a treaty of understanding to contest in the election. They had requested a\npeople's verdict for the winners to work as a constitutional council to design a new\nconstitution. The Samagi Peramuna (United Alliance) that won the majority of seats\nin the election established a new government. Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike became\nthe Prime Minister.

    "\uf076 Development of Agriculture\nThe food needed for the people was produced within the country because Sri Lanka\nhad been an agricultural country from the past. Yet, the British administration that\nlasted for 133 years paid attention to state plantation and did not pay enough\nattention to the local agriculture. The English imported the necessary food items to\nSri Lanka during their reign. As a result, by the time Sri Lanka got the independence,\na need had arisen to develop the production of food items within the country. Hence,\nevery government had to take steps to develop paddy cultivation.\n\uf076 Development of Paddy Cultivation\nTowards the latter part of the British reign in Sri Lanka, they had to pay attention to\ndeveloping the agriculture in Sri Lanka because of the difficulty of exporting food\ndue to the World War 1 and increasing food prices due to the economic demise in\n1929. Yet the most productive attempt was made during the period of the State\nCouncil (1931\u20131947). The reasons for the development of the paddy cultivation\nduring that era were appointing a Sri Lankan minister for the ministry of agriculture\nunder the Donoughmore constitution and Mr. D. S. Senanayake who had an interest\nto develop the agriculture becoming the Minister of Agriculture.\nThe flat and rich soil that was more suitable for paddy cultivation exists in the dry\nzone of the country and therefore , that area should be used for paddy cultivation\nagain. Therefore Mr. D. S. Senanayake started establishing farming settlements in\nthe dry zone.\n\uf076 Establishment of Farming Settlements\nObjectives of establishing farming settlements:\n\u2022 Reducing the increasing population and unemployment in the wet zone.\n\u2022 Improving the food production of the country.\n\u2022 Using the land of the dry zone for economic development by repairing the old\nlakes and irrigations of the dry zone.\n\u2022 Providing a solution to the competition for the land in wet zone and creating a\nsatisfied landed farming community.\n- 94 -",
    "Sri Lanka became self \u2013 sufficient with paddy because a vast era of the dry zone\nwas used for paddy cultivation. As a solution to the major problem that arose in the\narea, lack of water, our ancestors built a network of lakes and irrigations. But , after\nthe invasion of Kalinga Magha people had immigrated to the wet zone from the dry\nzone. Using thus given up dry zone again for paddy cultivation after 700 years was\na landmark of the development of paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka.\nChallenges the government faced in establishing new farming settlements:\n\u2022 Selecting people from the wet zone and making them settle in houses in the dry\nzone.\n\u2022 Supporting people to turn the lands that had been forests for a long time into\nfarm land and supplying irrigation facilities.\n\u2022 Providing the settlers with financial assistance till they get their first harvest.\n\u2022 Arranging health and education facilities for people.\n\u2022 Establishment of sales promotion programmes for the sale of products.\nSeveral farming settlements could be started even before independence because\nthere were effective plans to lay out necessary rules to overcome the difficulties.\nSome examples for such settlements were Kagama, Minneriya, Nachchaduwa,\nBeragama, Minipe, Parakrama Samudraya, Ridi Bedi Ella, Sangili Kanadarawa and\nOnichchei. After independence till about 1953, 15 more farming settlements were\nestablished. Bathmadika, Deva Huwa, Girithale, Paniyankadawala, Iranamadu, Gal\nOya, Kantale, Soraborawewa were such settlements.\nWith these new farming settlements there was great enthusiasm in the country to\nreconstruct lakes and building of irrigation. Galoya project is an example for that. It\nis the first multi-purpose development project started in Sri Lanka.\n\uf076 Mahaweli Project\nThe Mahaweli project takes an important place among the projects launched\ntargeting the economic development of the country after the independence. The\nMahaweli river that is fed by several tributaries begins in the western part of the\ncentral hills , flows across the Dumbara valley and joins sea at Trincomalee.

Because of these reforms about 62% of the land that belonged to those\nmega scale plantation companies was given to the government. As 10% of the state\nlands were distributed among farmers as small pieces of land, a group of small scale\nland owners was created.\nThe ownership of mega scale lands shifted from the private sector to the government\nby the 1975 land reforms.\nSeveral institutions were established after gaining independence for the management\nof state lands.\n\u2022 State Plantation Cooperation established in 1958.\n\u2022 Upcountry Estate Development Bureau established in 1976.\n\u2022 People\u2019s Estate Development Bureau established in 1976.\n- 100 -",

    "The colonization in North America that began with the establishment of Virginia\nState in 1607 by the British continued for about a century. A significant characteristic\nis the interference of individuals, groups of people and companies rather than the\ndirect influence of the British government in the colonization of America. The\nBritish government gave its approval and assistance in colonization. The British who\nwent to Northern America had established thirteen estates by 1733. Their names are\ngiven above.\nTwelve estates out of those thirteen were started between 1607 and 1682. The last\nBritish colony among those thirteen was Georgia. It was established in 1733. The\nnature of the first states shows that they were not started at the same time. The\nreasons for their start were also different. One reason for the establishment of these\nstates was the expectation of religious freedom and commercial benefits. Differences\nexisted among these states with regard to composition of population, life style and\neconomic matters. Nevertheless, they began to rise as a separate English speaking\ncommunity by the mid 18th century.\n\uf076 American States and the British Administration\nIt was mentioned above that the colonies were established in North America by\nBritish companies and different individuals\u2019 interference. Those who started\ncolonies took a warrant from the British government. There, they had to work under\nseveral conditions. Some of them were the acceptance of the authority of the British\ngovernment and imposing the same laws that were in Britain, in the new colonies.\nStates were ruled by a governor appointed to each state. There was a legislative\ncouncil elected from each state to assist the governor. The state citizens followed a\nlocal self governance system because of the long distance between the two countries\nand the absence of a developed communication system. The reasons for this are\nthat the colonies were situated far away from the mother country and Britain could\nnot pay much attention to colonies as it was involved in various battles in Europe.\nHence, till about 1763 Britain followed a flexible political policy regarding American\nstates. This led to the development of thoughts about freedom in the minds of state\ncitizens. Yet, they needed the assistance of Britain because they still had to face some\nproblems.\nThe settlers of American colonies had to face two problems regarding their security\nbefore 1763. The first was the threat of the French. The settlers of the colonies wanted\nthe protection of the British because the French power was there to the north of the\n- 108 -",
    "British colonies and they tried to consolidate their power. There was a war between\nthe British and the French between 1756 and 1763. It is called the seven year war.\nFrance was defeated in this war. The American colonists became free of the France's\nthreat because Britain and France signed a treaty of peace. The main obstacle that\ndisturbed the expansion of the American colonies to west was the Red Indians.\nWhen the French were powerful they had connection with the French against the\nBritish. This situation changed with the defeat of France. After that the policies\ncontinued by the British were able to minimize the threat of the Red Indians.\nAmericans no longer needed the British assistance regarding its protection because\nthe power of France was lost when they were defeated in the seven year war and the\nRed Indians\u2019 threat was diminished with new defence strategies.\n\uf076 Reasons for the Freedom Struggle\nThe British economic policy and commercial activities were continued in a way that\nwas beneficial to Britain. Thus, it was prohibited to produce in states, things that\nwere produced in Britain. Apart from that, tobacco, sugar, cotton, bee vax corn,\nbronze that were produced in the states should only be sold to Britain. The other\nproducts were also allowed to export only via Britain. Further, there was a condition\nthat the states should not compete with Britain regarding production or trade.\nThough these policies brought economic disadvantages to the people in states, they\ngot a stable market because of Britain. On the other hand, because the British laws\ndid not function too strictly in the colonies, they could engage in illegal transactions\nwith other nations and reduce their losses. Because of the above reasons there was\nno strong protest against the British economic system and laws in American states\ntill about 1763. Yet, because of the new laws introduced by Britain after 1763, there\nwere disparities between the two countries. This generated new ideas about freedom.\nBritain had to bear a huge cost in the seven year war and as a result of it their debts\nincreased. The British believed that the American states too should bear a part of\nthose debts and interest. Therefore, the British Prime Minister, George Granville\ndecided to systemize tax collection in the American states. He tightened the naval\npatrol in order to stop illegal transactions. More tax bills were passed to increase the\nincome that was gained from America. Three bills that were passed between 1764\nand 1765 were;\n1. Sugar Act\n2. Currency Note Act\n3. Stamp Act\n- 109 -",
    "According to the Sugar Act, more British naval forces were sent to the coastal areas\nresulting in fights between people and the naval officers. The Currency Note Act\nprohibited issuing of currency notes by states to pay debts. As a result, the people in\nstates had to pay debts in gold or silver. While there were increasing protests against\nthese two acts by the people in states, Britain passed a Stamp Bill on 1765. According\nto this act a tax was charged from all printed documents and warrants. The stamp\nlevy affected the high class people in American society such as traders, lawyers\nand printers and they started organizing protests. There were increasing protests\nagainst this act and the people in America refused to pay the stamp levy. People\nunited in organizing these protests against the levies on tea, glass, paper other than\nthe above mentioned taxes. In another bill passed in Britain, the American states\nwere ordered to provide accommodation and financial allocation for the British\nforces that were placed in America. When people started protests against these acts,\nBritain started to use repressive actions such as dissolving of constitutional councils\netc. Therefore, the Americans started to organize and struggle for independence.\nWhen this situation is summarized, several reasons for the American revolution\ncan be identified.\n\uf076 Reasons for the American Revolution\n\uf034 Americans were used to a self governing system with less interference from\nBritain.\n\uf034 The economic policy followed by Britain which was more beneficial for Britain\nitself.\n\uf034 The British government\u2019s inability to understand the expectation of those who\nlived in states.\n\uf034 New laws and bills passed after 1763\n\uf034 Britain\u2019s attempt to suppress the reasonable struggle of the people in states.\n\uf034 The desire for freedom among the people in states.\n\uf076 Struggle for Freedom\nStruggles that arose against the new acts and taxes imposed by the British after 1763\nkindled a desire for freedom among the people who lived in states. The strongest\nprotest came against the stamp levy. There, the struggle developed to refuse not only\nstamps but also British products. According to the tradition in Britain those days,\nthe power of imposing taxes was exercised by the parliament. The people in states\nbelieved that the British parliament had no power to impose taxes for their country\n- 110 -",
    "because no member from states represented the parliament. This idea quickly\npassed over to the American states and the slogan \u201cno member, no tax\u201d came out.\nThat became the slogan of the American freedom struggle. The protests that came\nout against economic matters thus became a political issue.\nThe British cancelled the Stamp Act because of the protests that came against it. But,\nthey declared that the British government had the power to impose laws regarding\nthe American states. The British government which understood that the Americans\nwere against the direct taxes like stamp levy, imposed several custom duties in 1767\nin order to get their income increased. Thus, custom duties were imposed upon\nitems such as glass, lead, paper, tea which were imported to America. Several fights\noccurred because of the attempt of Britain to obtain these taxes and the protests\nwere staged by the people in states against those attempts. Five people died in Boston\nwhen the British forces fired at such a protest campaign. Because of such acts, bitter\nfeelings about Britain emerged in the minds of the Americans. Britain had to suffer\nheavy losses than the income they got because the people in the states boycotted the\nBritish products. Therefore, all taxes were abolished except the tax on tea in 1770.\nThe tax on tea continued to prove the British power to impose taxes for America\nrather than to get an income.\nIn another bill passed in 1773, Britain gave power to one company to supply tea\nto American states. This created trouble to the traditional tea sale of the American\ntraders. Some Americans who were furious about this decision obstructed the trade\ncompanies to unload tea in America.\nIn December 1773, Boston citizens who entered under disguise a ship with tea that\nhad docked in Boston harbour threw 342 tea containers into the sea. This incident\nwhich is known as the \u2018Boston Tea Party\u2019 is believed to be the beginning of the\nAmerican revolution. In reply to this, the British took steps to close down the\nBoston harbour till the loss of tea was compensated. In addition to that, they took\nsteps to reform the administration of Massachusetts and Georgia states by imposing\nlaws without taking the ideas of the people into consideration. The people of states\nwho were angry about these submissive steps rallied to Philadelphia and conducted\na convention. This is treated as the first continental convention in the history of the\nAmerican revolution.\n- 111 -",
    "Fig 7.2 \u2013 Boston Tea Party\nThe Philadelphia convention was a landmark in the American freedom struggle.\nIt was declared that the British parliament had no authority in imposing laws for\nAmerican states, in this convention where 12 states were represented. Further\nproposals were passed to boycott the British products and to make people of states\narmed for their security. After this, the battle between the British government and\nAmerican states intensified. Many people died in an armed battle between the forces\nof the two parties in 1775 in Lexington, America. Later the state representatives\ngot together in Philadelphia again and decided to organize state soldiers as a\ncontinental force. George Washington was appointed the commander of that army.\nA committee was appointed in this meeting to obtain foreign aid for the American\nfreedom struggle.\nAfter setting the background to face the British forces, the united representative\nbureau issued the statement of America\u2019s independence on the 4th of July 1776.\nThis document exclaimed that human beings have rights from birth that cannot\nbe deprived of and they establish governments to protect them and declared the\nindependence of America. The British did not agree with this and started war against\nthe American states. These battles continued for several years. During the first two\nyears of the fights, the British forces became victorious. But, after some time they\nbegan to fail. They had to face difficulties because they were fighting in an unknown\nland, thousands of miles away from their motherland. France supported the\nAmerican forces during this war. Later Spain and Holland too joined the opposition\nof Britain. As a result, the American freedom struggle became problematic for\nBritain. Britain offered to have peace talks in 1783 because they had suffered losses\nin several battles that took place in America. As a result America was accepted as\nan independent country in the Paris Peace Pact signed in 1783. After that in 1789\nAmericans passed a new constitution. Thus George Washington became the first\npresident in America.\n- 112 -",
    "\uf076 Results of the Freedom Struggle\nThirteen states that were governed separately by Britain got together and won\nindependence marking a landmark in the world history. By that time, there were\nseveral other countries, in Asian and American continents which existed as colonies\nof European countries. The freedom struggle of America set an example to those\ncountries also. Some other results of the American revolution are;\n\uf034 the birth of the independent country called United States of America\n\uf034 an incident which displayed the value of independence to the whole human\nkind\n\uf034 generating an enthusiasm on human rights in the world\n\uf034 the first written unified constitution\n7.2 French Revolution\nThe uprising of the French people against the monarchy of France in 1789 and the\nestablishment of a new ruling system is called the \u2018French revolution\u2019. As a result of\nthe French revolution, there emerged a great attention on human rights in France\nand later it spread into the other countries in the world.\nFrance became a country with glory in Europe by the 18th century A.D. They\nhad marked a significant development in foreign trade and industrialization. The\ncondition of the french farmers was better than the other countries. France had\nbecome a signficant country in Europe in the aspect of intellectuals and social\ncustoms and traditions. Yet, due to the weak administration of their rulers, there\nwere several political, social and economic problems in France. Louis XVI was\nthe most responsible character for this demise. People started struggling for their\nrights based on freedom, equity and brotherhood against the corrupted ruling of\nLouis XVI. People protested against the monarchy in 1789 because they were under\nheavy suppression by those rulers. There were several reasons that resulted such an\nenvironment in France.\n\uf076 Political Reasons of the French Revolution\nBefore the revolution, it was a monarchy that existed in France. The dynasty that\ngoverned France was called Bourbon Monarchy. Louis XIV and Louis XVI were\nfamous kings of that dynasty. Kings believed that the kingship was anointed on\n- 113 -",

    "The French monarchy consisted of an advisory board headed by the king and a\nbench of ministers that functioned under the above mentioned advisory board. This\nmonarchy was highly corrupted. The local administration that was in the hands of\nthe aristocrats was extremely inefficient. Therefore, the government appointed a\ngroup of officers called \u201cintendant\u201d for local administration. But, the battle between\nthe aristocrats and new officers made people suffer because the congruence of the\nadministration was broken.\nPeople did not have a chance of complaining about their problems or protesting\nagainst the monarchy however much they had to suffer.\nThere was a board consisting of people\u2019s representatives which was called \u201cStates\nGeneral Council\u201d where the problems of the general public were discussed. Yet,\nit was not summoned for 175 years. Therefore the corrupted and inefficient\nadministration that existed in France monarchy led to a revolution in France.\n\uf076 Social Aspect of the French Revolution\nBy the time the revolution began there existed a feudal society in France. The feudal\nsystem was a monarchy that was run with the help of aristocrats who had captured\nland in masses.\nThere were three social strata as priests, aristocrats and general public other than\nthe royal family by the time of the revolution. Priests and aristocrats enjoyed all\nthe social benefits. Among the general public there were three groups as middle\nclass, farmers and labourers. Aristocrats and the priests were the minority whereas\ngeneral public was the majority. The middle class was a group that had earned\nmoney by trade and other business transactions. Yet, they did not have any political\nrecognition.\nIn countries like Britain, the middle class had got political power but in France, the\nmiddle class was disheartened because of the authoritarian power of the aristocrats.\nPriests were exempted from taxes and they lived on the tax money of the general\npublic. They were very rich. Most of the lands in France were owned by aristocrats.\nSome of the privileges enjoyed by them were;\n\uf034 permission to fish and hunt in any place of the country.\n\uf034 farmers were to go to the grinding mills, wine presses, bakeries owned by\n- 116 -",

Yet they\ndid not have proper recognition for their status. Though they were educated, all\ngovernment posts were given to uneducated, inefficient aristocrats. Because of this\nsituation, there emerged a concept that one\u2019s standard should be measured based\non their ability and wealth not on their birth. This provided the background for\nthe emergence of the concept of equality and it later laid the foundation for the\ndemocracy.\nAmong the under privileged in France the most suffered groups were farmers. They\nrepresented 92% of the French population. They though owned some land and\nworked very hard, had to pay taxes to inefficient aristocrats, were suppressed by\nheavy taxes and cost of living.\n\uf076 Economic Conditions that led to the French Revolution\nBy the time of the revolution, the French treasury was completely bankrupt.

As a result\nof this, one camp was created by Germany, Austria and Italy and the other was built\nincluding Britain, France and Russia.

There was a hatred between Germany\nand France since Germany was united. Germany thought of attacking France\nbefore she entered war and invaded Belgium and started attacking France through\nBelgium.

    "this situation. Germany too suffered the adverse effects of the world economic\ndemise of 1929. As a result the prices of goods and unemployment rate increased in\nGermany. There were labour strikes in some cities. Though many countries faced\nthis situation, Hitler\u2019s followers began to claim that the democratic Weimar Republic\ncould not solve problems.\nAdolf Hitler was an Austrian. He fought for\nGermany in World War I. He was imprisoned during\nthe Weimar Republic for conspiring against the\ngovernment. While in prison, he wrote a famous\nbook called, \u201cMein Kampf (My War)\u201d. He presented\nhis ideas about German Nazism in this book. Hitler\nwho was released from prison kept on spreading an\ninsane racism. He was able to become the German\nChancellor by capturing the power in the German\nparliament (Reichstag) in 1933. His party was named\nas National Socialist Party. Fig 8.6 Adolf Hitler\nNazism\n\u2022 Nazism which emerged against democracy, communism, and capitalism, bore\nas its basic concept that Germans are the noblest nation that descends from\npure Aryans.\n\u2022 Another special characteristic of Nazism is looking down upon Jews.\n\u2022 Hitler has explained Nazism in his book \u2018Mein Kampf\u2019.\n\u2022 Nazism is a political system that was based on party dictatorship.\nIt is said that Hitler had conducted speeches before his instructors to get practice in\nmaking public speeches to attract people. He came to power in 1933 with the support\nof the other members in the parliament. Yet, he gradually established his power\nand started being a dictator. When Hitler became the chancellor, the president of\nGermany was Von Hindenburg. Old Hindenburg died soon and Hitler grasped the\npresident\u2019s power also. He got his followers set fire to the parliament building in an\napproaching election and accused communists of it. Then he abolished all political\n- 136 -",
    "parties and started murdering his opponents such as communists and Jews. Here,\nhis secret police force, the Gestapo and the SS force engaged themselves in brutal\nmassacres. Hitler was a person who abused mass media completely for his advantage.\nHis media minister Goebbels, violated all media ethics and used mass media to\ncreate a public opinion which was partial to Hitler. Hitler completely disturbed the\ndemocracy of Germany. The freedom of press, freedom of meeting and freedom of\nexpressing ideas were completely banned. The contemporary Germans tolerated\nthese things with the expectation of a noble Germany as was promised by Hitler. The\nwestern capitalist countries did not oppose Hitler because they were happy about\nthe destruction caused to communism by Hitler\u2019s brutal massacres of communists\nin Germany. This apparently made Hitler more and more stubborn.\nHitler who quitted the League of the Nations Union in 1934 drew Germany back to\nwar. Hitler invaded neighbouring Austria in1938 and started a Nazi reign there by\nattaching it to Germany. Then, Hitler focused his attention on Czechoslovakia and\nby separating the Germans and Czechoslovakians, he supported the establishment\nof a new country called Sudetenland. After that, Hitler invaded both Sudetenland\nand Czechoslovakia and took them under the power of Germany. The western\ncountries did not oppose Hitler's actions till he invaded Poland. But with Hitler\u2019s\ninvasion of Poland, countries like Britain and France started fighting against Hitler.\nThat was the beginning of World War II. Hitler who came to power in 1933 started\nWorld War II by empowering Germany in 6 years and Allied forces including\nAmerica, England and Russia had to fight Hitler for 6 years to defeat him and wipe\nout Nazism from the world.\nDuring this period, Hitler had established concentration camps and got millions\nof innocent Jews and Russians assassinated. Some examples for such camps are\nAuschwitz, Bergen Belsen, Belzec and Sobibor.

One such strategy was to\nkeep the German forces in Russia till the severe cold season approached. The Nazi\nforces too underwent the same destiny Napoleon\u2019s forces faced. German forces were\nnot prepared to face a long winter season. Therefore, severe coldness, food shortage\nand diseases caused many deaths among German forces. Hitler was not tactful\nenough to retreat. Ignorant to the critical conditions his forces were facing in Russia,\nHitler commanded them to move forward. There, the Russian red forces were able\nto defeat the German forces easily.\n\uf076 Germany surrenders\nRussia continued fighting and progressed towards Germany liberating the areas that\nwere in the hands of Nazis. At the same time, French and American forces launched\nattacks from the western front. The allied forces that reached Germany by March\n1945 came to Berlin by May. Hitler and many of his commanders, who understood\nthat their defeat was close by, committed suicide. Thus, Germany surrendered with\nno conditions in May 1945.\n\uf076 Japan surrenders\nJapan captured using its military power, the British colonies such as; Singapore,\nMalaysia, Burma, Hong Kong. Later, they captured countries like Borneo, Java,\nSumatra and Philippines. Thus, by 1942 whole Southeast Asia except Ceylon and\nIndia seemed to have surrendered.\nJapan bombed Colombo on o5th April 1942 and Trincomalee on 07th April.

This document which explained why the allied forces joined the war, focused\nits attention on receiving international support for peace and paying attention to\nprotecting the independence and sovereignty of nations. Based on this agreement,\nnames of 26 nations who fought against axis\npowers were declared in January 1942 in\nWashington. The term \u2018United Nations\u2019 was\nfirst used here to name those nations. After\nthat, in October 1943, foreign ministers\nof Russia, Britain, America and China\nconducted discussions in Moscow about\nestablishing an international organization\nfor peace.\nFig 8.18 \u2013 The United Nations\nHeadquarters in Newyork\n- 148 -",

This war which was carried out without weapons was called the \u201cCold War\u201d\nor weaponless war.\nSeveral situations that came closer to fights were settled before developing into\nbattles by the mediation of the United Nations. Some examples for such situations\nare;\n\u2022 Suez Conflict\nThe president of Egypt, Abdul Gamal Nasser peoplised the Suez Canal following\nthe socialist economic tradition. Because French companies had to face difficulties\ndue to this decision, they sent forces of Israel, Britain and France to Suez area. The\nUnited Nations were able to settle this problem.\n\u2022 Gulf Conflict\nBased on an oil rig located in Iraq and Kuwait border, this conflict arose. Iraq\ninvaded Kuwait because of that.

    "war caused huge destruction. Later, the United Nations mediated and settled the\nmatter.\n\u2022 Cuban Missile Conflict\nThose who escaped to USA from Cuba during the Cuban Revolution got armed\ntraining in USA and came back to Cuba armed against the Fidel Castro\u2019s government.\nBecause the rebels were supported by USA, Russia placed missiles in Cuba so that\nUSA could be attacked. Because of this USA surrounded Cuba and placed missiles\nin Turkey aiming at Russia. This conflict was settled by the general secretary of the\nUnited Nations.\nSteps the United Nations can take to protect world peace today\nWe discussed above how several conflicts that took place between countries after\nWorld War II were settled by the United Nations Organization. There are several\nsteps the United Nations can take in resolution of conflicts that emerge between\ncountries and protecting world peace. When there are incidents that threaten world\npeace, the Security Council of United Nations mediates to settle the matter. That is\nbecause the main responsibility of international peace and security lies in the hands\nof the Security Council.\nSeveral steps the United Nations can take to protect world peace on the\nrecommendations of the Security Council are;\nImposing Economic Restrictions\nThe countries that do not respect the decisions of the United Nations are forced to\noblige their orders by imposing economic restrictions.\nTaking steps to limit and control the production of nuclear weapons\nWhen there is information about countries that start producing new nuclear\nweapons, the United Nations Commissions are sent to investigate them. Such\ncommissions were appointed to examine the nuclear weapons in North Korea and\nIraq.\nEmployment of Peace Keeping Forces\nThe peace keeping force of the United Nations is employed to control the situation\nwhen there are severe battles between two parties.\n- 154 -"
