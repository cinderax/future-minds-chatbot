C H A P T E R 2 Establishment of British Power in Sri Lanka Introduction You studied in grade 10, how the Portuguese came to Asia and how the Portuguese and the Dutch people occupied the coastal region of Sri Lanka. After those two nations, the next European nation that imposed its power on Sri Lanka was the British. They who spoke English language were called the English. This lesson explains how the English established their power in Sri Lanka and the struggles that arose against them in the first half of the 19th century. 2.1 Arrival of British in Asia The English who noticed that the Portuguese and the Dutch people were earning a lot of profit from the trade activities in Asia, also paid their attention to Asia. As a result, a group of English businessmen established the East India Trade Company in December 1600, by a royal warrant obtained from Queen Elizabeth I to do trade activities in Asia. The first fleet of ships of this company had gone to Sumatra islands and started trade

. That situation is explained as national renaissance in this battle lesson. 3.1 Background of the National Renaissance The Europeans tried to spread their religion and culture in the areas they conquered in Asia in order that they have a loyal group of people in those countries. When the Portuguese and the Dutch governed the coastal regions of the country, they had to restrict their religious and cultural activities to the areas they governed, because there was an independent kingdom in the upcountry.

The army of the newly formed French government after the French revolution invaded Holland in 1794. King William V who was the Stadtholder of Holland escaped to Britain

. The most significant change was the spreading of western culture in the country. The western education and studying of English language began to spread fast in the country after the Colebrooke reforms. It was the foreigners that prepared the curricula and conducted teaching in missionary schools and state aided schools. These schools too paved the way for the spreading of western culture in the country. Some aspects of the western culture invaded Sri Lanka through the behaviour of those who went to western countries for education. More Europeans were attracted to Sri Lanka during the 19th century because of the expansion of plantations, development of trade and the improvements of transport and communication that took place in the country. As a result their clubs, holiday resorts started to mushroom in the country accelerating the spreading of western culture

However, in the first half of the 18th century, the decline of the Mughal empire in India and the rise of French influence prompted a shift in English focus.  The English recognized the strategic importance of Trincomalee harbor, a crucial location for controlling naval activities in the Indian Ocean and securing India.  Therefore, the potential loss of Trincomalee to the French spurred greater English interest and involvement in Sri Lanka.  This marked the beginning of a significant increase in English attention toward the island.","2.2 The British focusing their Attention on Sri Lanka The English did not pay any attention to Sri Lanka for about a century after they Map 2.1 – Location of Sri Lanka and the Trincomalee harbour came to India. The reasons for this are that the English had not yet firmly established their power in India and the Dutch had a strong fort system in the coastal line of the island followed by the Portuguese.

Hence, the empire in India started to decline. There were two major reasons for that special importance of the geographical location of Sri Lanka and the great importance of attention. the Trincomalee harbour became the major reasons to draw the attention of the English to Sri Lanka. 1. The location of Sri Lanka 2. Getting valuable trade items such as cinnamon from Sri Lanka Sri Lanka was a famous country for spices like cinnamon even by that time. The English knew that Sri Lanka produced high quality cinnamon which had a good The English felt the importance of Sri Lanka owing to two reasons. They were; the demand in the European market and the Dutch earned a great profit by selling location of Sri Lanka close to India and Sri Lanka being an excellent centre for cinnamon. Therefore, the English wanted to take the sole authority of selling the administration of naval and trade activities in the maritime zone around India cinnamon into their hands. Other than cinnamon; pepper, cardamom, cloves, pearls, including the Bay of Bengal. The English strongly felt the necessity of a harbour to gems and ivory were some other items that had a good market. The English wanted repair the ships damaged due to enemy attacks in the fights between the British to establish the political power in this country because of the above mentioned and the French around the Bay of Bengal. The English had a special interest in the reasons. Trincomalee harbour. Some reasons that made the English to pay attention to the Trincomalee harbour are given below.  ACTIVITY 1  The location of Sri Lanka facing the Bay of Bengal Discuss the factors that drew the attention of the English to Sri Lanka under the  It was important for the British to protect the naval power in the eastern coast of following headings.

As a result, a group of English businessmen established the East India Trade Company in December 1600, by a royal warrant obtained from Queen Elizabeth I to do trade activities in Asia. The first fleet of ships of this company had gone to Sumatra islands and started trade. Then, another fleet of ships came to India under William Hokins and conducted discussions about trade with the Mughal emperor, Jahangir. At the beginning of their visits to Asia, the English tried to tighten their trade relations with Southeast Asian region. There had been fights between the Portuguese and the Dutch to claim the trade power in Southeast Asia during the first two decades of the 17th century. At certain occasions, the English have given their assistance to the Dutch against the Portuguese. The Dutch never expected to see the English developing a power in Southeast Asian islands where spices grew well, although they obtained the help of the English to fight their common enemy, the Portuguese. Because of this, in 1623, the Dutch attacked a fortress in a spices island, Ambon and killed a group of English people living there. As the English did not have sufficient power in the region to retaliate the Dutch attack, they withdrew themselves from the southeast asian region. It seems that they completely focused their attention on India after that. - 19 -, 3.1 Background of the National Renaissance The Europeans tried to spread their religion and culture in the areas they conquered in Asia in order that they have a loyal group of people in those countries.

Some examples are; • Spreading of English language in the island which was an international language • Development of transport and communication • Introduction of export plantation • Good effects of industrial revolution • Parliamentary system 5.4 Disadvantages Though there were some advantages of being a colony of British there were many problems by the time Sri Lanka received independence after being exploited for 133 years by a foreign empire

So busy building ""strong fort systems"" while completely failing to modernize Sri Lanka's socio-economic system.  They grew cinnamon and pepper, sure, but left the vast majority of the island untouched, a testament to their remarkable inefficiency.  Truly, a shining example of colonial management!","2.1 Arrival of British in Asia The English who noticed that the Portuguese and the Dutch people were earning a lot of profit from the trade activities in Asia, also paid their attention to Asia. As a result, a group of English businessmen established the East India Trade Company in December 1600, by a royal warrant obtained from Queen Elizabeth I to do trade activities in Asia. The first fleet of ships of this company had gone to Sumatra islands and started trade. Then, another fleet of ships came to India under William Hokins and conducted discussions about trade with the Mughal emperor, Jahangir. At the beginning of their visits to Asia, the English tried to tighten their trade relations with Southeast Asian region. There had been fights between the Portuguese and the Dutch to claim the trade power in Southeast Asia during the first two decades of the 17th century. At certain occasions, the English have given their assistance to the Dutch against the Portuguese. The Dutch never expected to see the English developing a power in Southeast Asian islands where spices grew well, although they obtained the help of the English to fight their common enemy, the Portuguese. Because of this, in 1623, the Dutch attacked a fortress in a spices island, Ambon and killed a group of English people living there. As the English did not have sufficient power in the region to retaliate the Dutch attack, they withdrew themselves from the southeast asian region. It seems that they completely focused their attention on India after that. - 19 -, 2.2 The British focusing their Attention on Sri Lanka The English did not pay any attention to Sri Lanka for about a century after they Map 2.1 – Location of Sri Lanka and the Trincomalee harbour came to India. The reasons for this are that the English had not yet firmly established their power in India and the Dutch had a strong fort system in the coastal line of the island followed by the Portuguese. The English began to pay more attention to The English knew that if the Trincomalee harbour which was an excellent centre Sri Lanka when they who were satisfied so far with trade power, started exercising for the security of India and for regulating the naval activities in the Indian Ocean political power on India in the first half of the 18th century because the Mughal fell into the hands of the French it would be a great loss for them. Hence, the empire in India started to decline. There were two major reasons for that special importance of the geographical location of Sri Lanka and the great importance of attention. the Trincomalee harbour became the major reasons to draw the attention of the English to Sri Lanka. 1. The location of Sri Lanka 2. Getting valuable trade items such as cinnamon from Sri Lanka Sri Lanka was a famous country for spices like cinnamon even by that time. The English knew that Sri Lanka produced high quality cinnamon which had a good The English felt the importance of Sri Lanka owing to two reasons. They were; the demand in the European market and the Dutch earned a great profit by selling location of Sri Lanka close to India and Sri Lanka being an excellent centre for cinnamon. Therefore, the English wanted to take the sole authority of selling the administration of naval and trade activities in the maritime zone around India cinnamon into their hands. Other than cinnamon; pepper, cardamom, cloves, pearls, including the Bay of Bengal. The English strongly felt the necessity of a harbour to gems and ivory were some other items that had a good market. The English wanted repair the ships damaged due to enemy attacks in the fights between the British to establish the political power in this country because of the above mentioned and the French around the Bay of Bengal. The English had a special interest in the reasons. Trincomalee harbour. Some reasons that made the English to pay attention to the Trincomalee harbour are given below.  ACTIVITY 1  The location of Sri Lanka facing the Bay of Bengal Discuss the factors that drew the attention of the English to Sri Lanka under the  It was important for the British to protect the naval power in the eastern coast of following headings.

Thus, Sri Lanka had been exploited for 133 years by the British. During this time they earned a vast wealth from the island to take to their country and used all resources of the island for their well being. Even under such conditions, there were certain benefits that the island could enjoy. Some examples are; • Spreading of English language in the island which was an international language • Development of transport and communication • Introduction of export plantation • Good effects of industrial revolution • Parliamentary system 5.4 Disadvantages Though there were some advantages of being a colony of British there were many problems by the time Sri Lanka received independence after being exploited for 133 years by a foreign empire. Although some citizens became wealthy during this period the majority of the people were touching the depth of poverty when independence was won. Thus, there was a vast disparity in distribution of income and an immediate need had arisen to increase public service and welfare. Some more disadvantages of staying a colony are; • spreading of western culture and deterioration of indigenous culture • spreading of alcohol consumption • emergence of a landless social group • downfall of self sufficient economic system and losing of indigenous knowledge • destruction of useful institutions such as village councils (Gamsabha) - 78 -, 2.1 – The Dutch stadtholder , William V were brought from Madras for the above posts and those who came from Madras did not have any knowledge about the local languages, culture and traditions. The relationship between the general public and the administrative officers became distanced because such a group of officers was appointed for the civil administration, legal system and income collection. The India Trade Company had spent a lot of money in capturing the coastal belt of Sri Lanka. Another significant feature of the British administration is their attempts to cover the above mentioned cost and to achieve fast profits. They imposed several new taxes in the coastal areas to meet the above target. People in the coastal areas were in trouble when they had to pay those taxes in cash. One such example is the newly introduced ‘tax on coconut trees.’ Thus, someone who owned more than 10 Fig 2.2 – The Kew Palace in England coconut trees had to pay a tax of one silver panam (six cents) for each coconut tree. People were irritated because the tax was charged without considering the nature of After Trincomalee fell into the hands of the British many other fortresses such as; the harvest and they had to pay it in cash.

Expansion to other fields The new knowledge that emerged in relation to industrial and technological fields as a result of industrial revolution did not limit itself to industries and productions. It spread to the other fields too. Fields like transport, communication and agriculture too had rapid development under the influence of the industrial revolution.  Expansion of transportation Many changes took place in the transport sector because of the influence of the industrial revolution. With the development of the industrial sector, a necessity of developing a road system arose for transporting raw materials to factories and transporting products to markets. Therefore in 1811, John McAdam introduced a new way of making roads. It is called “the Macadam Method.” - 7 -

Fig 1.12 – Several experiments to develop communication between two distanced places using electronic methods were conducted from the beginning of the 19th century.

[1.7 – Safety lamp produced by Humphry Davy Expansion of the Industrial Revolution The industrial revolution that took place in the fields of textile, coal and iron industries in Britain soon spread into the other fields also. When the nature of this expansion is considered, two types of expansions can be identified as expansion of industrial revolution to other fields and expansion of industrial revolution to other countries. 1. Expansion to other fields The new knowledge that emerged in relation to industrial and technological fields as a result of industrial revolution did not limit itself to industries and productions. It spread to the other fields too. Fields like transport, communication and agriculture too had rapid development under the influence of the industrial revolution.  Expansion of transportation Many changes took place in the transport sector because of the influence of the industrial revolution

In 1807, an American called Robert Fulton produced the steamboat. Henry Bell produced the steam ship in 1811 for passenger transport. It used firewood as fuel at the beginning and later coal. The production of motor car in 1885 by the German, Daimler and the production of the aeroplane by Wright brothers in 1903, made a huge change in the transport system. Thus, as a result of the expansion of the industrial revolution, there was a rapid change in all forms of transport; land, water and air transport. Fig 1.10 Daimler’s motor car Fig 1.11 Aeroplane produced by Wright brothers  Expansion of Communication Sector There was a rapid development in communication sector too in parallel to the development in transport. The postal service that existed in Britain up to this was very costly. A need arose to exchange letters quickly for a cheaper price in a shorter time for business activities

. As a result a wealthy class who could invest money on industries was created in that country. At the same time, there was a rapid growth in the population of Britain which resulted in a high demand for goods and in turn producing goods to meet the increasing demand became a challenge. This led to a development in the industrial sector. Further, there was an expansion of the knowledge of science as a result of the Renaissance that took place in Europe in 14th and 15th centuries. This knowledge was used in producing - 1 -] (Page 11)

A new postal service which was called ‘Penny Postal Service’ was started for this in 1840. A letter could be sent to any corner of the country by spending just a penny (pence) through this. There arose another need for sending messages between two places more quickly than sending letters with the rapid development of industrial and transport sector. As a result of the experiments conducted for this, Samuel Morse was able to start telegraph service in 1844. Sending messages between two places through a cable was started in this method using symbols. An immense change took place in the communication sector in 1895 when Guglielmo Marconi invented the method of sending messages through radio signals and then John Logie Baird invented the television. These two inventions supported not only the development of communication but also the development of trade and commerce including other economic activities. Fig

The establishment of factories expanded with the industrialization attracting more people to cities. This left their land in villages uncultivated. The rest of the minor proprietors had to give up their lands due to various reasons. Such small lands given up thus and the lands taken over from other farmers were combined together to make mega farms. Agriculture developed as a result of cultivating these lands which came under the encroaching movement. Change of crops in cultivation helped to reduce spreading of diseases and to increase productivity. Jethro Tull introduced the line sowing method with horse tethered ploughs. This method helped to reduce the number of seeds needed for sowing and increase productivity. Fig 1.15 Cultivation using change of crops At the same time, animal products increased due to the new technological methods used in animal husbandry. One example is the findings regarding breeding of sheep made by Robert Bakewell","The advancements described led to several key developments across various sectors.  In transportation, John McAdam's 1811 Macadam Method improved roads, while Robert Fulton's steamboat (1807) and Henry Bell's steamship (1811) revolutionized water transport.  The invention of the automobile by Daimler in 1885 and the airplane by the Wright brothers in 1903 further transformed land and air travel.  Communication saw improvements with the Penny Postal Service in 1840, Samuel Morse's telegraph in 1844, and Marconi's radio and Baird's television in 1895.  Agriculture benefited from mega-farms, crop diversification, new animal husbandry techniques, and improved methods like Jethro Tull's line sowing.  These advancements spurred economic growth and interconnectedness.","1.7 – Safety lamp produced by Humphry Davy Expansion of the Industrial Revolution The industrial revolution that took place in the fields of textile, coal and iron industries in Britain soon spread into the other fields also.

It was limited to Britain for about another half century. Yet, by the 19th century, the influence of the industrial revolution spread to the other countries in Europe and the rest of the world. Trade was the major reason for the emergence of the industrial revolution in Europe. When the situation of Europe in the 18th century is analyzed, it can be seen that France, Portugal and Spain other than Britain engaged themselves in colonization and extensive trade. Therefore, it is important to inquire into the reasons why such a revolution began in Britain.  Reasons for the Emergence of the Industrial Revolution in Britain Financial and commercial affairs started developing in Europe since the 16th century and by the 18th century, Britain had surpassed some of the other leading European countries such as Holland, France, Portugal and Spain. As a result a wealthy class who could invest money on industries was created in that country. At the same time, there was a rapid growth in the population of Britain which resulted in a high demand for goods and in turn producing goods to meet the increasing demand became a challenge. This led to a development in the industrial sector. Further, there was an expansion of the knowledge of science as a result of the Renaissance that took place in Europe in 14th and 15th centuries. This knowledge was used in producing - 1 -, 1.15 Cultivation using change of crops At the same time, animal products increased due to the new technological methods used in animal husbandry. One example is the findings regarding breeding of sheep made by Robert Bakewell. The invention of efficient equipment that came with the industrial revolution altered the field of agriculture completely. Machines were produced to clear forests, prepare the land and produce seeds. Further, paying attention on producing manure to achieve more productivity in agriculture is an important move. As a result of experiments done in this field, a type of manure called ‘Guano Fertilizers’ was produced in Africa for the first time in 1800. Then it was produced in America also. After some time chemical fertilizers and agro chemicals were produced. Agricultural and animal products could be sold at a cheaper price because they could be produced with less expenditure owing to the store facilities and modern transport methods that came as a result of the industrial revolution. As a result, there was a high demand for agro products. - 11 -",

All constitutional, executive and judiciary powers were centralized to the king. King Louis XIV who was mesmerized by this unlimited power once exclaimed, “I am the kingdom”. He further exclaimed, “whatever anticipated by me is lawful”. He enjoyed the power to arrest anybody with no any lawsuit and imprison for life time. People of France bitterly criticized this power. The king used this power to suppress his personal and political enemies and they were imprisoned in the prison called Bastille.

[7.2 French Revolution The uprising of the French people against the monarchy of France in 1789 and the establishment of a new ruling system is called the ‘French revolution’. As a result of the French revolution, there emerged a great attention on human rights in France and later it spread into the other countries in the world. France became a country with glory in Europe by the 18th century A.D. They had marked a significant development in foreign trade and industrialization. The condition of the french farmers was better than the other countries. France had become a signficant country in Europe in the aspect of intellectuals and social customs and traditions. Yet, due to the weak administration of their rulers, there were several political, social and economic problems in France. Louis XVI was the most responsible character for this demise.

The French monarchy consisted of an advisory board headed by the king and a bench of ministers that functioned under the above mentioned advisory board. This monarchy was highly corrupted. The local administration that was in the hands of the aristocrats was extremely inefficient. Therefore, the government appointed a group of officers called “intendant” for local administration. But, the battle between the aristocrats and new officers made people suffer because the congruence of the administration was broken. People did not have a chance of complaining about their problems or protesting against the monarchy however much they had to suffer. There was a board consisting of people’s representatives which was called “States General Council” where the problems of the general public were discussed. Yet, it was not summoned for 175 years. Therefore the corrupted and inefficient administration that existed in France monarchy led to a revolution in France

As a result of the French revolution, there emerged a great attention on human rights in France and later it spread into the other countries in the world. France became a country with glory in Europe by the 18th century A.D. They had marked a significant development in foreign trade and industrialization. The condition of the french farmers was better than the other countries. France had become a signficant country in Europe in the aspect of intellectuals and social customs and traditions. Yet, due to the weak administration of their rulers, there were several political, social and economic problems in France. Louis XVI was the most responsible character for this demise. People started struggling for their rights based on freedom, equity and brotherhood against the corrupted ruling of Louis XVI. People protested against the monarchy in 1789 because they were under heavy suppression by those rulers. There were several reasons that resulted such an environment in France.  Political Reasons of the French Revolution Before the revolution, it was a monarchy that existed in France.

 Other Political Parties Other than the above parties that presented candidates around the country in elections, there were several parties which were in function. The Labour Party pioneered by Mr. A. E. Gunasinghe and the Tamil Congress started by Mr. G. G. Ponnambalam are some examples for such parties. Among them the Tamil Congress held a significant place until the 1956 election. They who paid special attention on the rights of the Tamil people in this country were able to secure 07 seats in the 1947 election. It seems that the Tamil Congress lost its public support when Mr. J. V. Chelvanayagam started the Federal Party in 1949. According to the political party system that exists in Sri Lanka there are a number of minor parties other than the two major parties like United National Party and Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Because of that, there can be situations in which no party can claim a majority in an election

The prime objective of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party was to create a communist society in Sri Lanka according to the doctrine of leftist political points of view. Later a fraction of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party headed by Dr. S. A. Wickramasinghe established the Lanka Communist Party in 1943.  United National Party Though by 1946, there were several leftist parties and minority parties, there was no party for the politicians who had neutral ideas.

At the same time Sri Lanka got the parliamentary system allowing its people to join politics through the representative democracy. New changes occurred in the political system with the introduction of new constitutions in 1972 and 1978. This lesson focuses on the special features of the political system and the trends in the social and economic systems during the few decades after independence. 6.1 Soulbury Reforms and Independence The members of the Soulbury Commission that was appointed to investigate into Sri Lanka’s constitutional reforms and give proposals came to Sri Lanka in December 1944.

This prompted the formation of several parties, including the United National Party (UNP) in 1946 under D.S. Senanayake.  The UNP, drawing members from the Lanka National Congress and Sinhala Maha Sabha, aimed to contest the election.  Other parties like the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), established in 1935, and the Tamil Congress already existed, highlighting a growing political landscape. The 1947 election marked the beginning of the multi-party system in Sri Lanka, where multiple parties competed for power. The need to organize people and represent their views in the new parliamentary system fueled this development.","6.2 Development after Independence After the independence in 1948 politicians of this country had the responsibility of handling the economy of the country that had been used for the benefit of the British colonists for the betterment of the people.

Britain issued the royal order of the Soulbury Constitution in May, 1946 after the State Council passed the white paper which included the proposals of the Soulbury Commission report. Though the first election to be held under the Soulbury constitution was scheduled in mid 1947, Britain was reluctant to issue any statement about Sri Lanka’s independence.

C H A P T E R 3 National Renaissance in Sri Lanka Introduction The era in which Sri Lanka tried to win independence after the fights in 1848, is divided into two periods as national and religious renaissance and then the time of political agitation. From 1850 to 1915 the campaign on national and religious renaissance was prominent whereas from 1915 to 1948 people gave more prominence to political agitations. There were impediments to the existence of the culture and traditional religions after the British conquered the hill country in 1815. As a result Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims of the country were religiously and nationally aroused towards the end of the 19th century. That situation is explained as national renaissance in this lesson. 3.1 Background of the National Renaissance The Europeans tried to spread their religion and culture in the areas they conquered in Asia in order that they have a loyal group of people in those countries

If we really wanted to, we could just grab resources from other nations by force, like they did back then."," ACTIVITY 1. Mark the countries that joined in World War I on a map. 2. Explain three reasons for World War I. 3. Mention two results of World War I. 8.3. World War II We learned above that World War I ended by 1918 A.D. Another world war began to rise within two decades after World War I. As a result, another world war occurred. This devastating battle that lasted for six years from September 1939 to August 1945 is called World War II.  Reasons for World War II Though World War II began in 1939, it did not break out so suddenly. The competition that existed between powerful countries and the behaviour of some European countries set the background for another war in about a decade after World War I. When this situation is considered, several reasons that kindled the war can be identified. Let’s study those in detail. 01

Those countries had to be partial to the countries who gave them aid directly or indirectly and it became a problem for their sovereignty

. It was explained above that the objective of establishing the League of the League of the Nations Union was to protect world peace and avoiding war. Nevertheless, the Union did not possess power or ability to avoid war. Several countries entered into friendly agreements because the collaboratively established Nations Union to avoid wars failed in its task. As a result of this, the powerful nations started to be armed for the security of their group. This being armed set a background of war.  Participants of World War II Fig 8.10 – A German military submarine Fig 8.11 – Gas ovens used by Hitler to massacre the Jews and other prisoners of war (Map 8.2) - 140 - - 141 -

. Hitler who came to power in 1933 started World War II by empowering Germany in 6 years and Allied forces including America, England and Russia had to fight Hitler for 6 years to defeat him and wipe out Nazism from the world. During this period, Hitler had established concentration camps and got millions of innocent Jews and Russians assassinated. Some examples for such camps are Auschwitz, Bergen Belsen, Belzec and Sobibor. People of the whole world had to suffer due to the invasive policies carried out by leaders like Hitler during World War II. The development of the whole world was drawn back for several years because the whole world had to pay its attention to war. The biggest destruction after World War I was caused during World War II. - 137 -

. This apparently made Hitler more and more stubborn. Hitler who quitted the League of the Nations Union in 1934 drew Germany back to war. Hitler invaded neighbouring Austria in1938 and started a Nazi reign there by attaching it to Germany. Then, Hitler focused his attention on Czechoslovakia and by separating the Germans and Czechoslovakians, he supported the establishment of a new country called Sudetenland. After that, Hitler invaded both Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia and took them under the power of Germany. The western countries did not oppose Hitler's actions till he invaded Poland. But with Hitler’s invasion of Poland, countries like Britain and France started fighting against Hitler. That was the beginning of World War II. Hitler who came to power in 1933 started World War II by empowering Germany in 6 years and Allied forces including America, England and Russia had to fight Hitler for 6 years to defeat him and wipe out Nazism from the world","That's a very concerning statement.  World War II was not simply fueled by a desire for resources; it was a vastly more complex event with multiple causes. While resource acquisition played a role in some nations' expansionist policies, the war was also driven by intense nationalism, unresolved issues from World War I, the rise of aggressive dictatorships (like Hitler's Nazi Germany), and ideological conflicts between fascism, communism, and democracy.  The text mentions Hitler's invasion of Austria and Czechoslovakia, and his subsequent invasion of Poland as starting points of the war, demonstrating that the conflict stemmed from a range of aggressive actions motivated by ideology and power, not just resource scarcity.  To suggest that acquiring resources by force is a simple solution ignores the devastating human cost and global consequences of such actions.","8.17 – A statue built in commemoration of children killed in a village destroyed by Hitler’s forces World was divided into two camps like this after World War II and continued a battle to win their own ideas using different strategies other than weapons.

10,What was the first plane made by the wright brothers called,". Weaving clothes became a little faster with the invention of the flying shuttle by John K. in 1733. But the slowness in preparing threads needed in weaving clothes still remained a problem. According to the situation that was there at that time, threads produced by six thread makers per day were enough only for one weaver to work for one day. Therefore, there was some idea of increasing the pace of spinning. As a result of that enthusiasm, a person called James Hargreaves produced a machine called ‘Jenny’ in 1764 for cotton weaving. This machine was a manually operated one. Later in 1769, Richard Arkwright produced a more efficient, water powered spinning wheel. It was named as ‘water Fig 1.1 – The Jenny machine produced by James turbine’. Arkwright’s creation was an Hargreaves for spinning cotton in 1764 important production when compared to the other machines used for the same purpose in the past. But it was difficult to be used in houses because it was very big in size

Rise of the Industrial Revolution The industrial revolution in Britain was based on three industries as given below.  Textile industry  Iron and steel industry  Coal industry The development that occurred in these fields resulted in the gradual progress in other fields such as transport, communication and agriculture. Textile Industry Textile producers in Britain faced a challenge of increasing their textile products to meet the high demand that came from their own colonies. Weaving clothes became a little faster with the invention of the flying shuttle by John K. in 1733. But the slowness in preparing threads needed in weaving clothes still remained a problem

The postal service that existed in Britain up to this was very costly. A need arose to exchange letters quickly for a cheaper price in a shorter time for business activities. Fig 1.12 – Several experiments to develop communication between two distanced places using electronic methods were conducted from the beginning of the 19th century. As a result of this, an apparatus was produced to communicate using human voice, between two places through cables in 1876. It is called the ‘telephone’. It was produced by Alexander Graham Bell. - 9 -] (Page 19)

In 1807, an American called Robert Fulton produced the steamboat. Henry Bell produced the steam ship in 1811 for passenger transport. It used firewood as fuel at the beginning and later coal. The production of motor car in 1885 by the German, Daimler and the production of the aeroplane by Wright brothers in 1903, made a huge change in the transport system. Thus, as a result of the expansion of the industrial revolution, there was a rapid change in all forms of transport; land, water and air transport.

. The production of the steam engine by George Stephenson in 1814 became a landmark in the industrial revolution. As a result, trains could be used to transport coal and other products. The time spent for transport could be minimized by transporting products from factories to markets and transportation cost was reduced by being able to transport heavy loads of goods at a time. It is believed that George Stephenson who invented the locomotive engine was not able to read and write till he was 17 years old.

Making an electric Jenny and the Water Turbine oven to smelt ore by Wilhelm Siemens in produced a new machine called 1870 helped the improvement of iron and “Mule” around 1779. This helped steel industry. These mew creations paved to produce finer and stronger the way for a rapid improvement in iron threads. Then around 1785, Edmund and steel industry. Cartwright found a way of running the ‘Mule’ by steam power. Thus, within a period of about 30 years new machines and novel technical methods were invented to make spinning cotton more efficient.

Coal was popular as a cheap and efficient and household tools. They used firewood to smelt ore for this purpose. It was difficult fuel for smelting ore, running machines and household chores. Though the demand to meet the huge demand for iron and steel needed for the production of machinery for coal increased with the industrial development, mining coal was difficult. that emerged as a result of the industrial revolution using firewood. Several new inventions were made in order to find solutions to the problems such as removing the water that gathered in the mine when it was dug deep, poisonous Hence, alternative methods had to be looked for.
