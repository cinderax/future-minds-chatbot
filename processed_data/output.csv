attention.

Establishment of British
Power in Sri Lanka
Introduction
You studied in grade 10, how the Portuguese came to Asia and how the Portuguese
and the Dutch people occupied the coastal region of Sri Lanka. After those two
nations, the next European nation that imposed its power on Sri Lanka was the
British. They who spoke English language were called the English. This lesson
explains how the English established their power in Sri Lanka and the struggles
that arose against them in the first half of the 19th century.
2.1 Arrival of British in Asia
The English who noticed that the Portuguese and the Dutch people were earning a
lot of profit from the trade activities in Asia, also paid their attention to Asia. As a
result, a group of English businessmen established the East India Trade Company
in December 1600, by a royal warrant obtained from Queen Elizabeth I to do trade
activities in Asia. The first fleet of ships of this company had gone to Sumatra islands

[Chapter 1: The location of Sri Lanka | 2.2 The British focusing their Attention on Sri Lanka] (Page 38)","The English increased their attention on Sri Lanka in the first half of the 18th century due to two primary factors.  First, the Mughal empire in India, where the English were establishing their power, began to decline. Second, the strategic importance of Trincomalee harbor became apparent.  The English recognized that if the French gained control of this excellent harbor, vital for Indian Ocean naval activities and the security of India, it would represent a significant loss.  Therefore, the declining Mughal empire and the geopolitical significance of Trincomalee spurred greater English interest in Sri Lanka.","2.2 The British focusing their Attention on Sri Lanka, 2.1 Arrival of British in Asia","30, 29, 32, 33, 36, 34, 37, 40, 38"

 Universal Franchise
There was limited franchise to elect the members to the Legislative Council
since 1912. At the beginning, if one wanted to be a voter they should possess a
considerable wealth. Therefore, the poor general public could not enjoy franchise.
As a result, the percentage of franchise holders was just 4% of the population as late
as 1924. Females too did not enjoy this franchise. The Donoughmore Commission
explained the fact that the politicians did not pay enough attention to the problems
of the people with low income because those who enjoyed franchise were only the
wealthy class. At the same time, they pointed out the fact that the general public

considered the above mentioned fact as an obstacle to the freedom of the general
public proposed to reduce the power of the governor by estabilishing these councils.
There were 15 members in the legislative council appointed in 1833. Nine of them
were official members or those who were appointed in their position. The other 06
were unofficial members. Three of them were selected to represent Europeans and
one member each for the other three ethnicities; Sinhala, Tamil and Burger. The
governor exercised the power of appointing these 06 members.

5.3 Advantages of the British Reign
When Sri Lanka was a colony of British, its political and economic activities were
handled in a way that all benefits went to colonists. Thus, Sri Lanka had been
exploited for 133 years by the British. During this time they earned a vast wealth
from the island to take to their country and used all resources of the island for their
well being. Even under such conditions, there were certain benefits that the island
could enjoy. Some examples are;
• Spreading of English language in the island which was an international language
• Development of transport and communication
• Introduction of export plantation
• Good effects of industrial revolution
• Parliamentary system
5.4 Disadvantages
Though there were some advantages of being a colony of British there were many
problems by the time Sri Lanka received independence after being exploited for

5.4 Disadvantages
Though there were some advantages of being a colony of British there were many
problems by the time Sri Lanka received independence after being exploited for
133 years by a foreign empire. Although some citizens became wealthy during
this period the majority of the people were touching the depth of poverty when
independence was won. Thus, there was a vast disparity in distribution of income
and an immediate need had arisen to increase public service and welfare. Some
more disadvantages of staying a colony are;
• spreading of western culture and deterioration of indigenous culture
• spreading of alcohol consumption
• emergence of a landless social group
• downfall of self sufficient economic system and losing of indigenous knowledge
• destruction of useful institutions such as village councils (Gamsabha)

 Expansion of Agriculture
There was a rapid development in agriculture in parallel to the industrial revolution.
Several factors that affected this can be identified as;
 Beginning of mega farms
 Changing of crops
 Using new technology in animal husbandry
 Using new agricultural methods and equipment

In 1807, an American called Robert Fulton produced the steamboat. Henry Bell
produced the steam ship in 1811 for passenger transport. It used firewood as fuel at
the beginning and later coal. The production of motor car in 1885 by the German,
Daimler and the production of the aeroplane by Wright brothers in 1903, made
a huge change in the transport system. Thus, as a result of the expansion of the
industrial revolution, there was a rapid change in all forms of transport; land, water
and air transport.
Fig 1.10 Daimler’s motor car Fig 1.11 Aeroplane produced by

 Expansion of Communication Sector
There was a rapid development in communication sector too in parallel to the
development in transport. The postal service that existed in Britain up to this was
very costly. A need arose to exchange letters quickly for a cheaper price in a shorter
time for business activities.

a result of industrial revolution did not limit itself to industries and productions. It
spread to the other fields too. Fields like transport, communication and agriculture
too had rapid development under the influence of the industrial revolution.
 Expansion of transportation
Many changes took place in the transport sector because of the influence of the
industrial revolution. With the development of the industrial sector, a necessity
of developing a road system arose for transporting raw materials to factories and
transporting products to markets. Therefore in 1811, John McAdam introduced a
new way of making roads. It is called “the Macadam Method.”

facilities that were limited to the cities such as water, electricity and communication
reached the villages too.

The establishment of factories expanded with the industrialization attracting more
people to cities. This left their land in villages uncultivated. The rest of the minor
proprietors had to give up their lands due to various reasons. Such small lands
given up thus and the lands taken over from other farmers were combined together
to make mega farms. Agriculture developed as a result of cultivating these lands
which came under the encroaching movement.
Change of crops in cultivation
helped to reduce spreading
of diseases and to increase
productivity. Jethro Tull
introduced the line sowing
method with horse tethered
ploughs. This method helped
to reduce the number of seeds
needed for sowing and increase
productivity.
Fig 1.15 Cultivation using change of crops
At the same time, animal products increased due to the new technological methods
used in animal husbandry. One example is the findings regarding breeding of sheep
made by Robert Bakewell.

A new postal service which was called ‘Penny Postal Service’ was started for this in
1840. A letter could be sent to any corner of the country by spending just a penny
(pence) through this.
There arose another need for sending messages between two places more quickly
than sending letters with the rapid development of industrial and transport sector.
As a result of the experiments conducted for this, Samuel Morse was able to start
telegraph service in 1844. Sending messages between two places through a cable
was started in this method using symbols.
An immense change took place in the communication sector in 1895 when
Guglielmo Marconi invented the method of sending messages through radio signals
and then John Logie Baird invented the television. These two inventions supported
not only the development of communication but also the development of trade and
commerce including other economic activities.
Fig. 1.13 John Logie Baird and Fig 1.14 Marconi’s radio
the television he invented","Based on the provided text, the advancements in transportation and communication during the Industrial Revolution facilitated several other developments.  The improved road system, introduced by John McAdam in 1811 with his ""Macadam Method,"" allowed for easier transport of raw materials to factories and finished goods to markets. The invention of the steamboat in 1807 (Robert Fulton) and steamship in 1811 (Henry Bell) revolutionized water transport.  The automobile (Daimler, 1885) and the airplane (Wright brothers, 1903) further transformed land and air travel.  In communication, the Penny Postal Service (1840) made letter delivery affordable and widespread.  The telegraph (Samuel Morse, 1844) enabled faster message transmission, and the invention of the radio (Guglielmo Marconi, 1895) and television (John Logie Baird) drastically changed communication, boosting trade and commerce.  These technological advancements also contributed to the expansion of agriculture, with the development of mega-farms and new agricultural methods and equipment increasing productivity.  The overall effect was a shortening of the distance between villages and cities, bringing urban amenities like water, electricity, and communication to rural areas.","1.1 Beginning and Development of the Industrial Revolution, 6.3 Social Welfare Exporting of food items became limited because of the obstacles to naval transport","20, 19, 17, 114, 18, 14, 21"

To which monarchy did he belong, and what does this statement reveal about the nature of the power held by rulers of that time?","establishment of a new ruling system is called the ‘French revolution’. As a result of
the French revolution, there emerged a great attention on human rights in France
and later it spread into the other countries in the world.
France became a country with glory in Europe by the 18th century A.D. They
had marked a significant development in foreign trade and industrialization. The
condition of the french farmers was better than the other countries. France had
become a signficant country in Europe in the aspect of intellectuals and social
customs and traditions. Yet, due to the weak administration of their rulers, there
were several political, social and economic problems in France. Louis XVI was
the most responsible character for this demise. People started struggling for their
rights based on freedom, equity and brotherhood against the corrupted ruling of
Louis XVI. People protested against the monarchy in 1789 because they were under

them by the god. All constitutional, executive and judiciary powers were centralized
to the king. King Louis XIV who was mesmerized by this unlimited power once
exclaimed, “I am the kingdom”. He further exclaimed, “whatever anticipated by me
is lawful”. He enjoyed the power to arrest anybody with no any lawsuit and imprison
for life time. People of France bitterly criticized

monarch.

The French monarchy consisted of an advisory board headed by the king and a
bench of ministers that functioned under the above mentioned advisory board. This
monarchy was highly corrupted. The local administration that was in the hands of
the aristocrats was extremely inefficient. Therefore, the government appointed a
group of officers called “intendant” for local administration. But, the battle between
the aristocrats and new officers made people suffer because the congruence of the
administration was broken.
People did not have a chance of complaining about their problems or protesting
against the monarchy however much they had to suffer.
There was a board consisting of people’s representatives which was called “States
General Council” where the problems of the general public were discussed. Yet,
it was not summoned for 175 years. Therefore the corrupted and inefficient
administration that existed in France monarchy led to a revolution in France.

The three concepts; freedom, equality and brotherhood which were the main
slogans of the French revolution had high regard in the three quotations of the
above mentioned human rights convention. People who were suppressed around
the world by social inequality were blessed with this. As a result many countries in
the world later legalized the fundamental human rights in their constitution.
There were so many changes in France due to the French revolution. They can be
considered as results of the revolution. Some such changes are;
downfall of the French monarchy
relief for French farmers and labourers
instability of political states in France
Governments changed in quick succession after the revolution because those who
led the revolution had different political views. This situation lasted from 1789
to1799. Because of this unstable political situation, Napoleon Bonaparte, an army
officer captured power in France in 1799. After that, it was a completely new political

Voltaire explained the importance of expressing one’s own ideas freely. He severely
criticized the monarchy and the monopoly of the church.
Rousseau presented the concept people's sovereignty
through his book called ""The Social Contract"". He
exclaimed that the king must work for the betterment of
people; if otherwise, the people have the rights to chase
away such rulers. His ideas became the foundation of
equality and people’s sovereignty.
On the other hand, the French soldiers who went to
support the American freedom struggle had identified
concept of freedom there and started to activate it in
France encouraging the French revolution.
Fig 7.11 Rousseau
 The Revolution
By 1789 the closest reason for the French revolution is the situation arose due to the
financial problems in France where there had been continuous protests. A reform
in taxes was necessary to settle that situation. The king had to summon the council

called ‘Lafayette’. King Louise XVI and Queen Antoinette were trialed under the
rebels and both of them were sentenced to death.
 Results of the French Revolution
There were several changes in the political, economic and social sectors of France
due to the French revolution. Through this revolution in which people rose against
a powerful monarchy and unjust social economic system, world was gifted with
numerous experiences and examples. Some of those results are;
 the interest on fundamental human rights all over the world
The french revolutionalists published a human rights convention in 1791. It
explained that the fundamental human rights are rights that the people are born
with and not something that is given by the rulers. Some concepts mentioned in the
convention are;
 every human being should have equal rights because everybody is born a free
individual.
 every citizen has a right to be a part of imposing law.","King Louis XIV declared, ""I am the kingdom, whatever anticipated by me is lawful."" He belonged to the French monarchy.  This statement reveals that Louis XIV held absolute power, believing his will was law, and that he was above any legal or societal constraints.  The statement exemplifies the unchecked authority characteristic of many European monarchs during that era.  The provided text also notes that Louis XIV used this power to suppress opponents, imprisoning them in the Bastille.

elections, there were several parties which were in function. The Labour Party

held a significant place until the 1956 election. They who paid special attention on

established the Lanka Sama Samaja Party in Sri Lanka in 1935 to implement such
politics in a way suitable to Sri Lanka. The prime objective of the Lanka Sama

There was a religious and a cultural renaissance among the Hindus of this country
due to the challenge created to Hinduism as a result of the perpetuation of
missionaries. This Hindu renaissance movement was led by Arumuga Navalar. He
had good understanding about missionary activities because he had got his primary
education in a missionary school and had served under a priest of the Methodist
assembly. Therefore, he worked to establish schools for Hindus and establish presses,
brief Hindus by printed leaflets, books and public preaching.

National Renaissance in
Sri Lanka
Introduction
The era in which Sri Lanka tried to win independence after the fights in 1848, is
divided into two periods as national and religious renaissance and then the time of
political agitation.
From 1850 to 1915 the campaign on national and religious renaissance was
prominent whereas from 1915 to 1948 people gave more prominence to political
agitations.
There were impediments to the existence of the culture and traditional religions
after the British conquered the hill country in 1815. As a result Buddhists, Hindus
and Muslims of the country were religiously and nationally aroused towards the
end of the 19th century. That situation is explained as national renaissance in this
lesson.

3.1 Background of the National Renaissance
The Europeans tried to spread their religion and culture in the areas they conquered
in Asia in order that they have a loyal group of people in those countries. When
the Portuguese and the Dutch governed the coastal regions of the country, they
had to restrict their religious and cultural activities to the areas they governed,
because there was an independent kingdom in the upcountry. Doors opened for
the western culture to spread under the British reign throughout the country, with
the submission of the upcountry.
 Activities of Missionary Organizations
Several foreign organizations that came to Sri Lanka during the British reign started
spreading Catholicism in the country. They are called as missionary organizations.
Given below are some such missionary organizations that came to this country
from 1804 to 1818.

the ancient cities like Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa which were in decay covered
by forests after the downfall of those kingdoms. The knowledge of general public
about ancient culture and the national heritage expanded when the European scholars
like George Turner, Riis David, H.C.P. Bell and Henri Parker uncovered elements of
ancient culture through research, excavations and exploration of historical sources
and when the local scholars wrote books in parallel to those of the above mentioned
European scholars. In the same atmosphere, Walisingha Harischandra dedicated
for a movement to protect the religious places in Anuradhapura. Anagarika
Dharmapala fought hard to protect the religious places like Buddhagaya in India. At

1. Mark the countries that joined in World War I on a map.
2. Explain three reasons for World War I.
3. Mention two results of World War I.
8.3. World War II
We learned above that World War I ended by 1918 A.D. Another world war began to
rise within two decades after World War I. As a result, another world war occurred.
This devastating battle that lasted for six years from September 1939 to August 1945
is called World War II.
 Reasons for World War II
Though World War II began in 1939, it did not break out so suddenly. The
competition that existed between powerful countries and the behaviour of some
European countries set the background for another war in about a decade after
World War I. When this situation is considered, several reasons that kindled the war
can be identified. Let’s study those in detail.
01. Hitler's rise to power in Germany and his conduct
After World War I, western countries got together to establish a new government in

on these two countries. Countries headed by USA were called as capitalist camp and
the group led by Russia was identified as socialist camp.

called the ‘Cold War or Weaponless War’. This existed for about four decades after
World War II. Basic strategies employed here were;
• using spy services
• establishment of different organizations
• launching of aid programmes etc
After World War II, Asian and African countries got the opportunity of obtaining
independence getting freed from colonization. USA and Russia extended their
support to uplift the social and economic status of those countries. Their intention
was to win those countries to their camps. Those countries had to be partial to the

invasion of Poland, countries like Britain and France started fighting against Hitler.
That was the beginning of World War II. Hitler who came to power in 1933 started
World War II by empowering Germany in 6 years and Allied forces including
America, England and Russia had to fight Hitler for 6 years to defeat him and wipe
out Nazism from the world.
During this period, Hitler had established concentration camps and got millions
of innocent Jews and Russians assassinated. Some examples for such camps are
Auschwitz, Bergen Belsen, Belzec and Sobibor. People of the whole world had to
suffer due to the invasive policies carried out by leaders like Hitler during World
War II. The development of the whole world was drawn back for several years
because the whole world had to pay its attention to war. The biggest destruction
after World War I was caused during World War II.

It was explained above that the objective of establishing the League of the League of
the Nations Union was to protect world peace and avoiding war. Nevertheless, the
Union did not possess power or ability to avoid war.
Several countries entered into friendly agreements because the collaboratively
established Nations Union to avoid wars failed in its task. As a result of this, the
powerful nations started to be armed for the security of their group. This being
armed set a background of war.

the destruction caused to communism by Hitler’s brutal massacres of communists
in Germany. This apparently made Hitler more and more stubborn.
Hitler who quitted the League of the Nations Union in 1934 drew Germany back to
war. Hitler invaded neighbouring Austria in1938 and started a Nazi reign there by
attaching it to Germany. Then, Hitler focused his attention on Czechoslovakia and
by separating the Germans and Czechoslovakians, he supported the establishment
of a new country called Sudetenland. After that, Hitler invaded both Sudetenland
and Czechoslovakia and took them under the power of Germany. The western
countries did not oppose Hitler's actions till he invaded Poland. But with Hitler’s
invasion of Poland, countries like Britain and France started fighting against Hitler.
That was the beginning of World War II. Hitler who came to power in 1933 started

World War II were settled by the United Nations Organization. There are several
steps the United Nations can take in resolution of conflicts that emerge between
countries and protecting world peace. When there are incidents that threaten world
peace, the Security Council of United Nations mediates to settle the matter. That is
because the main responsibility of international peace and security lies in the hands
of the Security Council.
Several steps the United Nations can take to protect world peace on the
recommendations of the Security Council are;
Imposing Economic Restrictions
The countries that do not respect the decisions of the United Nations are forced to
oblige their orders by imposing economic restrictions.
Taking steps to limit and control the production of nuclear weapons
When there is information about countries that start producing new nuclear
weapons, the United Nations Commissions are sent to investigate them. Such

Daimler and the production of the aeroplane by Wright brothers in 1903, made
a huge change in the transport system. Thus, as a result of the expansion of the
industrial revolution, there was a rapid change in all forms of transport; land, water
and air transport.

 Expansion of Communication Sector
There was a rapid development in communication sector too in parallel to the
development in transport. The postal service that existed in Britain up to this was
very costly. A need arose to exchange letters quickly for a cheaper price in a shorter
time for business activities.
Fig 1.12 – Several experiments to develop communication between two distanced

threads needed in weaving clothes still remained a problem. According to the situation that
was there at that time, threads produced
by six thread makers per day were
enough only for one weaver to work for
one day. Therefore, there was some idea
of increasing the pace of spinning. As a
result of that enthusiasm, a person called
James Hargreaves produced a machine
called ‘Jenny’ in 1764 for cotton weaving.
This machine was a manually operated
one. Later in 1769, Richard Arkwright
produced a more efficient, water powered
spinning wheel. It was named as ‘water

to the other machines used for the same
purpose in the past. But it was difficult to be used in houses because it was very big in size.
On the other hand, because a fast tide of water was needed to run the machine, it could be

roads. The production of the steam engine by George Stephenson in 1814 became a
landmark in the industrial revolution. As a result, trains could be used to transport
coal and other products. The time spent for transport could be minimized by
transporting products from factories to markets and transportation cost was
reduced by being able to transport heavy loads of goods at a time. It is believed that
George Stephenson who invented the locomotive engine was not able to read and
write till he was 17 years old.

Samuel Crompton who used the steel. Steel could be produced cheaply and
functioning principles of Spinning quickly in this method. Making an electric
Jenny and the Water Turbine oven to smelt ore by Wilhelm Siemens in
produced a new machine called 1870 helped the improvement of iron and
“Mule” around 1779. This helped steel industry. These mew creations paved
to produce finer and stronger the way for a rapid improvement in iron
threads. Then around 1785, Edmund and steel industry.
Cartwright found a way of running
the ‘Mule’ by steam power. Thus,
within a period of about 30 years
new machines and novel technical
methods were invented to make
spinning cotton more efficient.

A new postal service which was called ‘Penny Postal Service’ was started for this in
1840. A letter could be sent to any corner of the country by spending just a penny
(pence) through this.
There arose another need for sending messages between two places more quickly
than sending letters with the rapid development of industrial and transport sector.
As a result of the experiments conducted for this, Samuel Morse was able to start
telegraph service in 1844. Sending messages between two places through a cable
was started in this method using symbols.
An immense change took place in the communication sector in 1895 when
Guglielmo Marconi invented the method of sending messages through radio signals
and then John Logie Baird invented the television. These two inventions supported
not only the development of communication but also the development of trade and
commerce including other economic activities.

Even the vehicles that carry heavy loads of goods and passengers could be driven
fast and easily on these roads. Therefore, hundreds of miles of such roads were built
in Britain and Scotland within a short period.
Machines and engines used for transport too developed with the development of
roads. The production of the steam engine by George Stephenson in 1814 became a
landmark in the industrial revolution. As a result, trains could be used to transport
coal and other products. The time spent for transport could be minimized by

American forces during this war. Later Spain and Holland too joined the opposition
of Britain. As a result, the American freedom struggle became problematic for
Britain. Britain offered to have peace talks in 1783 because they had suffered losses
in several battles that took place in America. As a result America was accepted as
an independent country in the Paris Peace Pact signed in 1783. After that in 1789
Americans passed a new constitution. Thus George Washington became the first
president in America.

The number of the members of the Legislative Council was increased to 37 by this
reform. Among them 14 were official members and 23 were unofficial members.
Seven of the unofficial members were nominated by the governor. The other 16

to introduce another reform within a short time. There was another constitutional
reform in 1924 following this. It was named as ‘Manning – Devonshire Reforms.’

that a constitutional reform is necessary because 75
years had passed after the Colebrooke reforms were

The French monarchy consisted of an advisory board headed by the king and a
bench of ministers that functioned under the above mentioned advisory board. This
monarchy was highly corrupted. The local administration that was in the hands of
the aristocrats was extremely inefficient. Therefore, the government appointed a
group of officers called “intendant” for local administration. But, the battle between
the aristocrats and new officers made people suffer because the congruence of the
administration was broken.
People did not have a chance of complaining about their problems or protesting
against the monarchy however much they had to suffer.
There was a board consisting of people’s representatives which was called “States
General Council” where the problems of the general public were discussed. Yet,
it was not summoned for 175 years. Therefore the corrupted and inefficient
administration that existed in France monarchy led to a revolution in France.

• Continuous water supply to the dry zone farm lands for productive agricultural
work.
• Production of electricity to cover the increasing demand for electricity.
• Creating more settlements through water supply and the expansion of cultivation
of food by providing the landless people with lands.
Other than these main objectives there were other objectives such as generating
jobs and agricultural opportunities, controlling flood, breeding fresh water fish etc.
Thus, the Mahaweli project became a multi-purpose project.
The first stage of the Mahaweli project was to build a dam at Pollgolla across the
Mahaweli river to take water to Sudu Ganga and take that water to the dry zone via
Bovathenna reservoir. There were further plans to take water from this part to Kala

• Arranging health and education facilities for people.
• Establishment of sales promotion programmes for the sale of products.
Several farming settlements could be started even before independence because
there were effective plans to lay out necessary rules to overcome the difficulties.
Some examples for such settlements were Kagama, Minneriya, Nachchaduwa,
Beragama, Minipe, Parakrama Samudraya, Ridi Bedi Ella, Sangili Kanadarawa and
Onichchei. After independence till about 1953, 15 more farming settlements were

Oya, Kantale, Soraborawewa were such settlements.
With these new farming settlements there was great enthusiasm in the country to
reconstruct lakes and building of irrigation. Galoya project is an example for that. It
is the first multi-purpose development project started in Sri Lanka.
 Mahaweli Project

Steps were taken to build reservoirs such as Kothmale, Victoria, Randenigala,
Rantambe, Ulhitiya, Rathkinda, Madru Oya; dams such as Minipe and some water
turning centres.
Victoria Reservoir
This vast reservoir was made by building a
dam, a little lower to the Polgolla dam. One
of the main objectives of building this dam
was generating hydro–electricity. The British
government provided aids for this project.
Kothmale Reservoir
The Kothmale reservoir was made by building
a dam at Kadadora across Kothmale Oya
which is one of the main tributaries of the
Mahaweli river. The Sweden government
provided aids for this.

 Establishment of Publishers
Rev. Bulathgama Dhammalankara Siri Sumanathissa thero took steps to open a
press which many Buddhists longed to have for a long time. The thero worked to get
financial assistance from the King of Thailand (Siam) because the funds collected
from Sri Lankan philanthropists were not enough for the purpose. Another
significant landmark in Buddhist renaissance is the establishment of ‘Lankopakara
Printers’ using the money collected thus in 1862 at Galle. After that, several presses
were established in several places of the country by the Buddhists. Some such
Buddhist publishers were;

the ancient cities like Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa which were in decay covered
by forests after the downfall of those kingdoms. The knowledge of general public
about ancient culture and the national heritage expanded when the European scholars
like George Turner, Riis David, H.C.P. Bell and Henri Parker uncovered elements of
ancient culture through research, excavations and exploration of historical sources
and when the local scholars wrote books in parallel to those of the above mentioned
European scholars. In the same atmosphere, Walisingha Harischandra dedicated
for a movement to protect the religious places in Anuradhapura. Anagarika
Dharmapala fought hard to protect the religious places like Buddhagaya in India. At
the same time, the renovations of Ruwanweli Seya also commenced around 1870.

incidents that took place during the Buddhist renaissance were the getting the
government to declare the Vesak full moon poya day as a
holiday and the introduction of the Buddhist flag which
is in use even today.
Because of the establishment of Buddhist schools and
pirivens, a religious younger generation that understood
the value of the culture emerged. Among those youths,
there were true sons of the motherland and a group
of national writers who highlighted the greatness of
the indigenous culture. The leaders like Anagarika
Dharmapala, Walisinghe Harischandra, Piyadasa Sirisena
Fig 3.4 – Walisinghe
and John De Silva among those youths used different

types of media to arouse patriotism and nationalism
among the natives. As a result, by the on set of the 20th century, a movement to kindle
patriotism among the natives, a movement to protect Buddhist religious places and
a non-alcoholic movement had been started through the Buddhist renaissance.

All the above mentioned philanthropists gave financial assistance in opening
Buddhist schools. Because of this dedication they were able to start Buddhist schools
in several cities of Sri Lanka. Some of those schools are;
• Ananda Vidyalaya – Colombo
• Dharmaraja Vidyalaya – Kandy
• Mahinda Vidyalaya – Galle
• Vijaya Vidyalaya – Matale
• Jinaraja Vidyalaya – Gampola
• Anurudhdha Vidyalaya – Nawalapitiya
There was a development in printing sector because of the Buddhist renaissance and
this led people to develop their intelligence by reading various books, magazines and
newspapers. Because of this motivation for education, their literacy was improved.
Missionary organizations worked to develop the English education. Other important
incidents that took place during the Buddhist renaissance were the getting the
government to declare the Vesak full moon poya day as a
holiday and the introduction of the Buddhist flag which
is in use even today.

Anagarika Dharmapala presented a new vision elucidating the importance of past
civilization and the value of harmonious living as Buddhists. He worked for this
target by preaching in public and writing to the publications like ‘Sinhala Bauddhaya’
and the magazine ‘Mahabodhi.’
Mr. Piyadasa Sirisena criticized the tendency of Sri Lankans
to embrace the western culture unscrupulously, through his
novels and the newspapers like “Sinhala Jathiya.” Other
than them, a number of Buddhist monks and lay scholars
started briefing the citizens on appreciating the indigenous
culture.

 Protection of Buddhist Religious Places

 Establishment of Buddhist Schools
Although the Buddhists had developed a lot in preaching and written medium,
they could not establish a Buddhist school system to compete with the missionary
education system. Buddhists did not have sufficient funds and organizational ability
to establish and run schools. After Sir Olcott came to Sri Lanka Buddhists also found
this opportunity. Sir Henry Steel Olcott came to Sri Lanka, became a Buddhist and
pioneered to start Buddhist schools although he was a foreigner.

Sir Olcott gave guidance in starting the ‘Colombo Parama Vignanartha Movement’

4.2 The 1910 Reforms and their Background
 Demands of the Sri Lankan Middle Class
During the 19th century a significant change occurred in the economy and the
society due to the Colebrooke reforms. As a result of this, the old elite class faded
out paving the way to a new Sri Lankan middle class to appear by the beginning of
the 20th century. In parallel to the changes that took place in the economy and the
society during the 70 years after 1833, no change occurred in the political system.
As the Sri Lankan middle class was unhappy about this, they began to demand for a
constitutional reform during the period between 1908 - 1909.
Mr.James Pieris presented a formal petition for the first time to the secretary of the
colonies requesting a constitutional reform in December 1908. After that, several
other organizations had followed Mr. James Pieris. Low Country Production Club,
Chilaw Club, Jaffna Club are some of them.

the decision of the government to impose a new excise ordinance in 1912 giving
permission to open new toddy bars.
How a temperance movement emerged through the religious renaissance in protest
to the increasing alcohol consumption during the British reign was explained in
Unit Three. The purpose of this temperance movement was to make people aware
of the harmful effects of alcohol consumption and help them give up the bad habit.
But, protests were staged against the new excise policy of the government in 1912.
The pioneers of this protest were the middle class people who could not win their
demands from 1910 reforms. As a result, these protests in 1912 had a political
inclination. Some distinguished features of these protests were;
• attempting to create a public opinion against the excise policy of the government
• unison of the middle class English educated and the activists of the religious
renaissance

 Distinguished Features of those Reforms
Several reforms that widely changed the political and economic systems of the
country were introduced under the Colebrooke reforms. Some of the distinguished
features among them were;
• Establishment of the executive and legislative councils.
• Introduction of a ruling system which combined both upcountry and low
country.
• Dividing the island into five provinces.
• Repealing compulsory service system.
• Discontinuation of the trade monopoly of the government.
A special feature of the Colebrooke Commission is the establishment of a legislative
council and an executive council. The governor was exercising an immense power
when the Colebrooke Commission came to Sri Lanka. The commission which
considered the above mentioned fact as an obstacle to the freedom of the general
public proposed to reduce the power of the governor by estabilishing these councils.
There were 15 members in the legislative council appointed in 1833. Nine of them

Establishment of British
Power in Sri Lanka
Introduction
You studied in grade 10, how the Portuguese came to Asia and how the Portuguese
and the Dutch people occupied the coastal region of Sri Lanka. After those two
nations, the next European nation that imposed its power on Sri Lanka was the
British. They who spoke English language were called the English. This lesson
explains how the English established their power in Sri Lanka and the struggles
that arose against them in the first half of the 19th century.
2.1 Arrival of British in Asia
The English who noticed that the Portuguese and the Dutch people were earning a
lot of profit from the trade activities in Asia, also paid their attention to Asia. As a
result, a group of English businessmen established the East India Trade Company
in December 1600, by a royal warrant obtained from Queen Elizabeth I to do trade
activities in Asia. The first fleet of ships of this company had gone to Sumatra islands

2.3. Establishment of British Power
Three distinguished stages can be seen in the colonization of Sri Lanka by the British.
 The English East India Trade Company capturing the coastal areas of the island
in 1796.
 Turning the coastal areas governed under the East India Trade Company into a
colony of the British crown.
 Capturing the hill country by the British in 1815.
 Establishment of British Power in the Coastal Areas of Sri Lanka
The new political situation that emerged in Europe after the French revolution in
1789, affected the colonization in Asia by the Europeans. The army of the newly
formed French government after the French revolution invaded Holland in 1794.
King William V who was the Stadtholder of Holland escaped to Britain. Holland,

 Results of the French Revolution
There were several changes in the political, economic and social sectors of France
due to the French revolution. Through this revolution in which people rose against
a powerful monarchy and unjust social economic system, world was gifted with
numerous experiences and examples. Some of those results are;
 the interest on fundamental human rights all over the world

explained that the fundamental human rights are rights that the people are born
with and not something that is given by the rulers. Some concepts mentioned in the
convention are;

administration went into the hands of the rebels. Rebels could make the country
calm by establishing a national security force and rebel committees under the leader
called ‘Lafayette’. King Louise XVI and Queen Antoinette were trialed under the
rebels and both of them were sentenced to death.

establishment of a new ruling system is called the ‘French revolution’. As a result of
the French revolution, there emerged a great attention on human rights in France
and later it spread into the other countries in the world.
France became a country with glory in Europe by the 18th century A.D. They
had marked a significant development in foreign trade and industrialization. The
condition of the french farmers was better than the other countries. France had
become a signficant country in Europe in the aspect of intellectuals and social
customs and traditions. Yet, due to the weak administration of their rulers, there
were several political, social and economic problems in France. Louis XVI was
the most responsible character for this demise. People started struggling for their
rights based on freedom, equity and brotherhood against the corrupted ruling of
Louis XVI. People protested against the monarchy in 1789 because they were under

It is clear that the people of the upcountry had grievances over the loss of freedom
they enjoyed under a ruling system of their own even during the times when the low
country was governed by the Portuguese and the Dutch.
Even though it was announced after the colonization that the king of Britain was
the king of the upcountry also; the people of the hill country had never seen the so
called king. They wanted a king who lived in their capital city, who could listen to
their grievances and give solutions to them instead of a never seen king who lived
in a country thousands of miles away. Because they could not see a king they tend
to believe that the country was throneless. The following two poems believed to be
composed by a monk who lived those days displaying the distress they had because
they did not have a king.

The Germany’s next target was Britain. Hitler decided to invade Britain using his
air force and commanded them to bomb British air ports and cities. Britain too
possessed strong naval and air forces. Then, Britain too employed fighter planes

Severe battles took place between the allied forces and Japan resulting in the defeat
of Japan. Because the final warning issued to already losing Japan by allied forces
was ignored, USA attacked Hiroshima on 06th August, 1945 and Nagasaki on 09th
August with atomic bombs. The two cities were destroyed in a few seconds and

World War II were settled by the United Nations Organization. There are several
steps the United Nations can take in resolution of conflicts that emerge between
countries and protecting world peace. When there are incidents that threaten world
peace, the Security Council of United Nations mediates to settle the matter. That is
because the main responsibility of international peace and security lies in the hands
of the Security Council.
Several steps the United Nations can take to protect world peace on the
recommendations of the Security Council are;
Imposing Economic Restrictions
The countries that do not respect the decisions of the United Nations are forced to
oblige their orders by imposing economic restrictions.
Taking steps to limit and control the production of nuclear weapons
When there is information about countries that start producing new nuclear
weapons, the United Nations Commissions are sent to investigate them. Such

the future generations free of threats of devastating wars started its functioning by
establishing the ‘Atomic Energy Commission.’ They must have started with this
step to show the world the necessity of controlling atomic energy because of the
destruction caused by the atomic bombs in World War II.
The powerful countries tend to work strategically for the victory of their camp as
a result of the two camps created after World War II with USA and Russia as two
heads. This war which was carried out without weapons was called the “Cold War”
or weaponless war.
Several situations that came closer to fights were settled before developing into
battles by the mediation of the United Nations. Some examples for such situations
are;
