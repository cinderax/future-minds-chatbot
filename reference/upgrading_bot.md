Certainly! Here’s a detailed plan and a suggested project structure to help you implement advanced features that will elevate your RAG agent project and make it stand out in the competition.

## Advanced RAG Agent Project Plan

### 1. **Project Goals**
- Enhance the existing RAG pipeline with advanced multi-agent capabilities.
- Improve answer accuracy, context relevance, and user experience.
- Add new functionalities such as task planning, summarization, translation, and web search.
- Ensure modular, scalable, and maintainable code structure.

### 2. **Feature Breakdown & Implementation Plan**

| Feature | Description | Implementation Steps | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Task Planner Agent** | Break down complex queries into sub-tasks and delegate them to specialized agents. | - Design a planner module that takes user input and outputs a sequence of tasks.<br>- Integrate with existing agents (chunker, vector_db, summarizer, translator).<br>- Use prompt engineering or a small LLM to guide task decomposition. | High |
| **Summarizer Agent** | Summarize retrieved documents or answers for quick user consumption. | - Integrate a summarization model (e.g., HuggingFace transformers).<br>- Add summarization step after context retrieval and before final answer generation.<br>- Allow user to request summary or detailed answers. | High |
| **Translator Agent** | Support multilingual queries and responses by translating inputs and outputs. | - Use translation APIs or models (e.g., Google Translate API, MarianMT).<br>- Detect language of input.<br>- Translate query to English (if needed), process, then translate answer back. | Medium |
| **Sentiment Analyzer Agent** | Detect user sentiment to adjust response tone and style. | - Integrate sentiment analysis model.<br>- Use sentiment to modify response style (formal, empathetic, casual). | Medium |
| **Web Search Agent** | Fetch real-time information from the web when document context is insufficient. | - Integrate a web search API (e.g., Bing Search, Google Custom Search).<br>- Combine web results with document context.<br>- Use a ranking mechanism to prioritize sources. | High |
| **Refine Context Retrieval** | Improve vector search accuracy and efficiency. | - Experiment with embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, SentenceTransformers).<br>- Tune vector DB parameters.<br>- Add hybrid search (keyword + vector). | High |
| **Answer Faithfulness & Reference Accuracy** | Ensure answers are strictly based on retrieved context with proper citations. | - Implement answer grounding techniques.<br>- Extract exact document references (page, paragraph).<br>- Display references alongside answers. | High |
| **Langflow Integration** | Use Langflow to visually design and manage agent workflows. | - Model multi-agent pipeline in Langflow.<br>- Export and integrate Langflow flows into your app.<br>- Use Langflow for rapid prototyping and debugging. | Medium |

### 4. **Milestones & Timeline**

| Week | Tasks |
|-------|-------|
| **Week 1** | - Design Task Planner Agent.<br>- Integrate Summarizer Agent.<br>- Refactor existing code for modularity. |
| **Week 2** | - Implement Translator Agent.<br>- Add Sentiment Analyzer.<br>- Improve context retrieval (embedding & vector DB tuning). |
| **Week 3** | - Integrate Web Search Agent.<br>- Implement answer faithfulness and reference extraction.<br>- Add detailed logging and error handling. |
| **Week 4** | - Integrate Langflow for workflow management.<br>- Testing, optimization, and documentation.<br>- Prepare demo and competition submission. |

---

### 5. **Additional Tips**

- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for each agent to ensure robustness.
- **Logging:** Implement detailed logging for debugging and performance monitoring.
- **User Interface:** If you have a UI, add options for users to select summary/detailed mode, language preferences, and feedback.
- **Performance:** Profile your app to identify bottlenecks and optimize latency.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation for your codebase and usage instructions.
